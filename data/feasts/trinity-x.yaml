introit: 'When I called upon the Lord, he regarded my petition, yea, from
    the battle that was against me: and he brought them down, even he that
    is of old, and endureth for ever; O cast thy burden upon the Lord, and
    he shall nourish thee. Hear my prayer, O Lord, and hide not thyself from
    my petition: take heed unto me, and hear me. Glory be to the Father, and
    to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost. As it was in the beginning, is now,
    and ever shall be: world without end. Amen.'
collect: LET thy merciful ears, O Lord, be open to the prayers of thy humble
    servants; and that they may obtain their petitions make them to ask such
    things as shall please thee; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
epistle_ref: 1 Corinthians 12:1-11
epistle: CONCERNING spiritual gifts, brethren, I would not have you ignorant.
    Ye know that ye were Gentiles, carried away unto these dumb idols, even
    as ye were led. Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking
    by the Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed; and that no man can say that
    Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost. Now there are diversities of
    gifts, but the same Spirit. And there are differences of administrations,
    but the same Lord. And there are diversities of operations, but it is
    the same God, who worketh all in all. But the manifestation of the Spirit
    is given to every man to profit withal. For to one is given by the Spirit
    the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit;
    to another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by
    the same Spirit; to another the working of miracles; to another prophecy;
    to another discerning of spirits; to another divers kinds of tongues;
    to another the interpretation of tongues. But all these worketh that one
    and the self-same Spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will.

gospel_ref: St. Luke 19:41-47
gospel: 'AND when he was come near, he beheld the city, and wept over it,
    saying, If thou hadst known, even thou, at least in this thy day, the
    things which belong unto thy peace! but now they are hid from thine eyes.
    For the days shall come upon thee, that thine enemies shall cast a trench
    about thee, and compass thee round, and keep thee in on every side, and
    shall lay thee even with the ground, and thy children within thee; and
    they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another; because thou knewest
    not the time of thy visitation. And he went into the temple, and began
    to cast out them that sold therein, and them that bought, saying unto
    them, It is written, My house is the house of prayer: but ye have made
    it a den of thieves. And he taught daily in the temple.'
offertory: 'Unto thee, O Lord, lift I up my soul: O my God, in thee have I
    trusted, let me not be confounded: neither let mine enemies triumph over
    me: for all they that look for thee shall not be ashamed.'
communion: 'Thou shalt be pleased with the sacrifice of righteousness, with
    the burnt offerings and oblations: upon thine altar, O Lord.'
