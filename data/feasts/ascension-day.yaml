introit: 'Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? Alleluia:
    in like manner as ye have seen him going up into heaven, so shall he come
    again, alleluia, alleluia, alleluia. And while they looked steadfastly
    toward heaven, as he went up: behold, two men stood by them in white apparel,
    which said unto them. Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the
    Holy Ghost. As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be: world
    without end. Amen.'
collect: GRANT, we beseech thee, Almighty God, that like as we do believe
    thy only-begotten Son our Lord Jesus Christ to have ascended into the
    heavens; so we may also in heart and mind thither ascend, and with him
    continually dwell, who liveth and reigneth with thee and the Holy Ghost,
    one God, world without end. Amen.
epistle_ref: Acts 1:1-11
epistle: 'THE former treatise have I made, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus
    began both to do and teach, until the day in which he was taken up, after
    that he through the Holy Ghost had given commandments unto the Apostles
    whom he had chosen: to whom also he shewed himself alive after his passion,
    by many infallible proofs; being seen of them forty days, and speaking
    of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God: and, being assembled together
    with them, commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem,
    but wait for the promise of the Father, which, saith he, ye have heard
    of me. For John truly baptized with water, but ye shall be baptized with
    the Holy Ghost not many days hence. When they therefore were come together,
    they asked of him, saying, Lord, wilt thou at this time restore again
    the kingdom to Israel? And he said unto them, It is not for you to know
    the times or the seasons, which the Father hath put in his own power.
    But ye shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you;
    and ye shall be witnesses unto me, both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea,
    and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth. And when he
    had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up, and a cloud
    received him out of their sight. And while they looked steadfastly toward
    heaven, as he went up, behold, two men stood by them in white apparel;
    which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven?
    This same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come,
    in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven.'
gat: Alleluia Proper
alleluia: 'Alleluia. Alleluia. God is gone up with a merry noise: and the
    Lord with the sound of the trumpet. Alleluia. Christ to highest heaven
    ascending, led captivity captive: and gave gifts unto men. Alleluia.'
gospel_ref: St. Mark 16:14-end
gospel: 'JESUS appeared unto the eleven as they sat at meat, and upbraided
    them with their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they believed
    not them which had seen him after he was risen. And he said unto them,
    Go ye into all the world, and preach the Gospel to every creature. He
    that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not
    shall be damned. And these signs shall follow them that believe: In my
    name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues; they
    shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not
    hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover. So
    then after the Lord had spoken unto them, he was received up into heaven,
    and sat on the right hand of God. And they went forth and preached every
    where, the Lord working with them, and confirming the word with signs
    following.'
offertory: 'God is gone up with a merry noise: and the Lord with the sound
    of the trumpet, alleluia.'
