epistle_ref: Acts 2:1-11
epistle: 'WHEN the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one
    accord in one place. And suddenly there came a sound from heaven, as of
    a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting.
    And there appeared unto them cloven tongues, like as of fire, and it sat
    upon each of them: and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began
    to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance. And there
    were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, out of every nation under
    heaven. Now when this was noised abroad, the multitude came together,
    and were confounded, because that every man heard them speak in his own
    language. And they were all amazed, and marvelled, saying one to another,
    Behold, are not all these which speak Galilaeans? And how hear we every
    man in our own tongue wherein we were born? Parthians, and Medes, and
    Elamites, and the dwellers in Mesopotamia, and in Judaea, and Cappadocia,
    in Pontus, and Asia, Phrygia, and Pamphylia, in Egypt, and in the parts
    of Libya about Cyrene, and strangers of Rome, Jews and proselytes, Cretes
    and Arabians, we do hear them speak in our tongues the wonderful works
    of God.'

gospel_ref: St. John 14:15-end
gospel: 'JESUS said unto his disciples, If ye love me, keep my commandments.
    And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that
    he may abide with you for ever; even the Spirit of truth, whom the world
    cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye
    know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you. I will not leave
    you comfortless; I will come to you. Yet a little while, and the world
    seeth me no more; but ye see me: because I live, ye shall live also. At
    that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in
    you. He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth
    me; and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love
    him, and will manifest myself to him. Judas saith unto him, (not Iscariot,)
    Lord, how is it that thou wilt manifest thyself unto us, and not unto
    the world? Jesus answered and said unto him, If a man love me, he will
    keep my words, and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him,
    and make our abode with him. He that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings:
    and the word which ye hear is not mine, but the Father''s which sent me.
    These things have I spoken unto you, being yet present with you. But the
    Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name,
    he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance,
    whatsoever I have said unto you. Peace I leave with you, my peace I give
    unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart
    be troubled, neither let it be afraid. Ye have heard how I said unto you,
    I go away, and come again unto you. If ye loved me, ye would rejoice,
    because I said, I go unto the Father: for my Father is greater than I.
    And now I have told you before it come to pass, that, when it is come
    to pass, ye might believe. Hereafter I will not talk much with you: for
    the prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in me. But that the
    world may know that I love the Father; and as the Father gave me commandment,
    even so I do.'
offertory: 'Stablish the thing, O God, that thou hast wrought in us: for thy
    temple''s sake at Jerusalem, shall kings bring presents unto thee, alleluia.'
communion: 'I will not leave you comfortless; I will come to you yet again,
    alleluia: and your heart shall be joyful, alleluia, alleluia.'
