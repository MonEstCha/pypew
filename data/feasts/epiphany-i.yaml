name: Epiphany I
introit: 'On a throne exalted I beheld, and lo, a man sitting, whom a legion
    of angels worship, singing together: behold, his rule and governance endureth
    to all ages. O be joyful in God, all ye lands: serve the Lord with gladness.
    Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost: As it was
    in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be: world without end. Amen.'
collect: O LORD, we beseech thee mercifully to receive the prayers of thy
    people which call upon thee; and grant that they may both perceive and
    know what things they ought to do, and also may have grace and power faithfully
    to fulfil the same; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
epistle_ref: Romans 12:1-5
epistle: I BESEECH you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye
    present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which
    is your reasonable service. And be not conformed to this world; but be
    ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is
    that good, and acceptable, and perfect will of God. For I say, through
    the grace given unto me, to every man that is among you, not to think
    of himself more highly than he ought to think, but to think soberly, according
    as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith. For as we have many
    members in one body, and all members have not the same office; so we,
    being many, are one body in Christ, and every one members one of another.

gospel_ref: St. Luke 2:41-end
gospel: 'NOW his parents went to Jerusalem every year at the feast of the
    passover. And when he was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem,
    after the custom of the feast. And when they had fulfilled the days, as
    they returned, the child Jesus tarried behind in Jerusalem; and Joseph
    and his mother knew not of it. But they, supposing him to have been in
    the company, went a day''s journey, and they sought him among their kinsfolk
    and acquaintance. And when they found him not, they turned back again
    to Jerusalem, seeking him. And it came to pass, that after three days
    they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the doctors, both
    hearing them, and asking them questions. And all that heard him were astonished
    at his understanding and answers. And when they saw him, they were amazed:
    and his mother said unto him, Son, why hast thou thus dealt with us? behold,
    thy father and I have sought thee sorrowing. And he said unto them, How
    is it that ye sought me? wist ye not that I must be about my Father''s
    business? And they understood not the saying which he spake unto them.
    And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was subject unto
    them: but his mother kept all these sayings in her heart. And Jesus increased
    in wisdom, and stature, and in favour with God and man.'
offertory: 'O be joyful in the Lord, all ye lands; serve the Lord with gladness,
    and come before his presence with a song: be ye sure that the Lord he
    is God.'
communion: 'Son, why hast thou thus dealt with us? Behold, thy father and
