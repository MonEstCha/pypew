collect: 'O GOD, who wast pleased that thy word should take flesh of the womb of the 
    Blessed Virgin Mary at the message of an angel: grant to thine humble servants; that 
    we, who believe her to be the mother of God, may be aided by her intercession in Thy
    sight. Through the same Jesus Christ our Lord, who liveth and reigneth with thee, in
    the unity of the Holy Spirit, one God, world without end. Amen.'
