introit: 'Call to remembrance thy tender compassion and mercy, O Lord, and
    thy loving-kindnesses towards us, which have been ever of old: neither
    suffer our enemies to triumph against us; deliver us, O God of Israel,
    out of all our misery and trouble. Unto thee, O Lord, do I lift up my
    soul: my God, in thee have I trusted, let me not be confounded.'
collect: 'ALMIGHTY God, who seest that we have no power of ourselves to help
    ourselves: Keep us both outwardly in our bodies, and inwardly in our souls;
    that we may be defended from all adversities which may happen to the body,
    and from all evil thoughts which may assault and hurt the soul; through
    Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.'
epistle_ref: 1 Thessalonians 4:1-8
epistle: WE beseech you, brethren, and exhort you by the Lord Jesus, that
    as ye have received of us how ye ought to walk, and to please God, so
    ye would abound more and more. For ye know what commandments we gave you
    by the Lord Jesus. For this is the will of God, even your sanctification,
    that ye should abstain from fornication; that every one of you should
    know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honour; not in the
    lust of concupiscence, even as the Gentiles which know not God; that no
    man go beyond and defraud his brother in any matter; because that the
    Lord is the avenger of all such, as we also have forewarned you and testified.
    For God hath not called us unto uncleanness, but unto holiness. He therefore
    that despiseth despiseth not man, but God, who hath also given unto us
    his Holy Spirit.

    is grievously vexed with a devil. But he answered her not a word. And
    his disciples came and besought him, saying, Send her away; for she crieth
    after us. But he answered and said, I am not sent, but unto the lost sheep
    of the house of Israel. Then came she and worshipped him, saying, Lord,
    help me. But he answered and said, It is not meet to take the children''s
    bread, and to cast it to dogs. And she said, Truth, Lord; yet the dogs
    eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters'' table. Then Jesus answered
    and said unto her, O woman, great is thy faith: be it unto thee even as
    thou wilt. And her daughter was made whole from that very hour.'
