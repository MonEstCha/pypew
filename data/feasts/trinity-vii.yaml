introit: 'O clap your hands together all ye people: O sing unto God with the
    voice of joy and triumph. He shall subdue the people under us: and the
    nations under our feet. Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to
    the Holy Ghost. As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be:
    world without end. Amen.'
collect: 'LORD of all power and might, who art the author and giver of all
    good things: Graft in our hearts the love of thy name, increase in us
    true religion, nourish us with all goodness, and of thy great mercy keep
    us in the same; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.'
epistle_ref: Romans 6:19-end
epistle: 'I SPEAK after the manner of men, because of the infirmity of your
    flesh: for as ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness, and
    to iniquity, unto iniquity; even so now yield your members servants to
    righteousness, unto holiness. For when ye were the servants of sin, ye
    were free from righteousness. What fruit had ye then in those things whereof
    ye are now ashamed? for the end of those things is death. But now being
    made free from sin, and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto
    holiness, and the end everlasting life. For the wages of sin is death:
    but the gift of God is eternal life, through Jesus Christ our Lord.'

gospel_ref: St. Mark 8:1-9
gospel: 'IN those days the multitude being very great, and having nothing
    to eat, Jesus called his disciples unto him, and saith unto them, I have
    compassion on the multitude, because they have now been with me three
    days, and have nothing to eat: and if I send them away fasting to their
    own houses, they will faint by the way; for divers of them came from far.
    And his disciples answered him, From whence can a man satisfy these men
    with bread here in the wilderness? And he asked them, How many loaves
    have ye? And they said, Seven. And he commanded the people to sit down
    on the ground. And he took the seven loaves, and gave thanks, and brake,
    and gave to his disciples to set before them; and they did set them before
    the people. And they had a few small fishes; and he blessed, and commanded
    to set them also before them. So they did eat, and were filled: and they
    took up of the broken meat that was left seven baskets. And they that
    had eaten were about four thousand. And he sent them away.'
offertory: 'Like as in the burnt offerings of rams and bullocks; and like
    as in ten thousands of fat lambs: so let our sacrifice be in thy sight
    this day, that it may please thee; for they shall not be confounded that
    put their trust in thee, O Lord.'
communion: Bow down thine ear to me; make haste to deliver me.
