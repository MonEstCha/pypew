introit: 'Thus saith the Lord, I know the thoughts that I think towards you,
    thoughts of peace, and not of affliction: ye shall call upon me, and I
    will hearken unto you, and will bring  you again in your captivity from
    every nation. Lord, thou art become gracious unto thy land: thou hast
    turned away the captivity of Jacob. Glory be to the Father, and to the
    Son, and to the Holy Ghost: As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever
    shall be: world without end. Amen.'
collect: 'O GOD, our refuge and strength, who art the author of all godliness:
    Be ready, we beseech thee, to hear the devout prayers of thy Church; and
    grant that those things which we ask faithfully we may obtain effectually;
    through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.'
epistle_ref: Philippians 3:17-end
epistle: BRETHEREN, be followers together of me, and mark them which walk
    so as ye have us for an ensample. (For many walk, of whom I have told
    you often, and now tell you even weeping, that they are the enemies of
    the cross of Christ; whose end is destruction, whose god is their belly,
    and whose glory is in their shame, who mind earthly things.) For our conversation
    is in heaven; from whence also we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus
    Christ; who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like
    unto his glorious body, according to the working whereby he is able even
    to subdue all things unto himself.
gat: Gradual and Alleluia Proper

gospel_ref: St. Matthew 22:15-22
gospel: 'THEN went the Pharisees and took counsel how they might entangle
    him in his talk. And they sent out unto him their disciples, with the
    Herodians, saying, Master, we know that thou art true, and teachest the
    way of God in truth, neither carest thou for any man: for thou regardest
    not the person of men. Tell us therefore, what thinkest thou? Is it lawful
    to give tribute unto Caesar, or not? But Jesus perceived their wickedness,
    and said, Why tempt ye me, ye hypocrites? shew me the tribute-money. And
    they brought unto him a penny. And he saith unto them, Whose is this image
    and superscription? They say unto him, Caesar''s. Then saith he unto them,
    Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar''s; and unto
    God the things that are God''s. When they had heard these words, they
    marvelled, and left him, and went their way.'
offertory: 'Out of the deep have I called unto thee, O Lord: Lord, hear my
    voice.'
communion: 'Verily I say unto you, what things soever ye desire, when ye pray:
    believe that ye receive them, and it shall be done unto you.'
