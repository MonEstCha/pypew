introit: "Be thou my God and defender, and a place of refuge that thou mayest\
    \ save me: for thou art my upholder, my refuge, and my Saviour; and for\
    \ thy holy Name\u2019s sake be thou my leader, and my sustainer. In thee,\
    \ O Lord, have I put my trust; let me never be put to confusion: but rid\
    \ me, and deliver me in thy righteousness. Glory be to the Father, and\
    \ to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost: As it was in the beginning, is now,\
    \ and ever shall be: world without end. Amen."
collect: 'O LORD, who hast taught us that all our doings without charity are
    nothing worth: Send thy Holy Ghost, and pour into our hearts that most
    excellent gift of charity, the very bond of peace and of all virtues,
    without which whosoever liveth is counted dead before thee. Grant this
    for thine only Son Jesus Christ''s sake. Amen.'
epistle_ref: 1 Corinthians 13:1-end
epistle: 'THOUGH I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not
    charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal. And though
    I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge;
    and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have
    not charity, I am nothing. And though I bestow all my goods to feed the
    poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it
    profiteth me nothing. Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth
    not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up, doth not behave itself
    unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil,
    rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth; beareth all things,
    believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things. Charity
    never faileth: but whether there be prophecies, they shall fail; whether
    there be tongues, they shall cease; whether there be knowledge, it shall
    vanish away. For we know in part, and we prophesy in part. But when that
    which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away.
    When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought
    as a child; but when I became a man, I put away childish things. For now
    we see through a glass darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part;
    but then shall I know even as also I am known. And now abideth faith,
    hope, charity, these three: but the greatest of these is charity.'
gat: Gradual and Tract Proper
gradual: 'Thou art the God that doeth wonders: And hast declared thy power
    among the people. Thou hast mightily delivered thy people: even the sons
    of Jacob and Joseph.'
tract: 'O be joyful in the Lord, all ye lands: serve the Lord with gladness.
    Come before his presence with a song: be ye sure that the Lord he is God.
    It is he that hath made us, and not we ourselves: we are his people, and
    the sheep of his pasture.'
gospel_ref: St. Luke 18:31-end
gospel: 'THEN Jesus took unto him the twelve, and said unto them, Behold,
    we go up to Jerusalem, and all things that are written by the prophets
    concerning the Son of Man shall be accomplished. For he shall be delivered
    unto the Gentiles, and shall be mocked, and spitefully entreated, and
    spitted on: and they shall scourge him, and put him to death; and the
    third day he shall rise again. And they understood none of these things:
    and this saying was hid from them, neither knew they the things which
    were spoken. And it came to pass, that as he was come nigh unto Jericho,
    a certain blind man sat by the way-side begging: and hearing the multitude
    pass by, he asked what it meant. And they told him, that Jesus of Nazareth
    passeth by. And he cried, saying, Jesus, thou Son of David, have mercy
    on me. And they which went before rebuked him, that he should hold his
    peace: but he cried so much the more, Thou Son of David, have mercy on
    me. And Jesus stood, and commanded him to be brought unto him: and when
    he was come near, he asked him, saying, What wilt thou that I should do
    unto thee? And he said, Lord, that I may receive my sight. And Jesus said
    unto him, Receive thy sight; thy faith hath saved thee. And immediately
    he received his sight, and followed him, glorifying God: and all the people,
    when they saw it, gave praise unto God.'
offertory: 'Blessed art thou, O Lord; O teach me thy statutes: with my lips
    have I been telling of all the judgements of thy mouth.'
communion: 'They did eat, and were well filled, for the Lord gave them their
    own desire: they were not disappointed of their lust.'
