coeaster: 28
introit: 'O sing unto the Lord a new song, alleluia; for the Lord hath done
    marvellous things alleluia: in the sight of the nations hath he shewed
    his righteous judgements, alleluia, alleluia. With his own right hand,
    and with his holy arm: hath he gotten himself the victory. Glory be to
    the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost. As it was in the beginning,
    is now, and ever shall be: world without end. Amen.'
collect: O ALMIGHTY God, who alone canst order the unruly wills and affections
    of sinful men; Grant unto thy people, that they may love the thing which
    thou commandest, and desire that which thou dost promise; that so, among
    the sundry and manifold changes of the world, our hearts may surely there
    be fixed, where true joys are to be found; through Jesus Christ our Lord.
    Amen.
epistle_ref: St. James 1:17-21
epistle: EVERY good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh
    down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither
    shadow of turning. Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth,
    that we should be a kind of first-fruits of his creatures. Wherefore,
    my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow
    to wrath; for the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God. Wherefore
    lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness, and receive with
    meekness the engrafted word, which is able to save your souls.
gat: Alleluia Proper
alleluia: 'Alleluia. Alleluia. I go to him that sent me: but because I have
    said these things unto you, sorrow hath filled your hearts. Alleluia.
    I tell you the truth: it is expedient for you that I go away. Alleluia.'
gospel_ref: St. John 16:5-15
gospel: 'JESUS said unto his disciples, Now I go my way to him that sent me,
    and none of you asketh me, Whither goest thou? But, because I have said
    these things unto you, sorrow hath filled your heart. Nevertheless, I
    tell you the truth; it is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go
    not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will
    send him unto you. And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin,
    and of righteousness, and of judgement: of sin, because they believe not
    on me; of righteousness, because I go to my Father, and ye see me no more;
    of judgement, because the prince of this world is judged. I have yet many
    things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now. Howbeit, when he,
    the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he
    shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he
    speak: and he will shew you things to come. He shall glorify me: for he
    shall receive of mine, and shall shew it unto you. All things that the
    Father hath are mine: therefore said I, that he shall take of mine, and
    shall shew it unto you.'
offertory: 'O be joyful in God all ye lands; sing praises unto the honour
    of his Name: O come hither, and hearken, all ye that fear God, and I will
    tell you what things he has done for my soul, alleluia.'
communion: 'When the Comforter, the Spirit of Truth, is come; he will reprove
    the world of sin: and of righteousness, and of judgement, alleluia.'
