    to their exceeding joy and comfort: Grant unto us thy people, that as
    Mary did rejoice to be called the Mother of the Lord, so we may ever rejoice
    to believe the incarnation of thine only-begotten Son; to whom with thee
    and the Holy Ghost be all honour and glory, world without end. Amen.'
