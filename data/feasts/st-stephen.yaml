introit: 'Princes moreover did sit, and did witness falsely against me, and
    the ungodly pressed sore upon me: O Lord my God, stand up to help me;
    for thy servant is occupied continually in thy commandments. Blessed are
    those that are undefiled in the way: and walk in the law of the Lord.
    Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost: As it was
    in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be: world without end. Amen.'
collect: GRANT, O Lord, that in all our sufferings here upon earth, for the
    testimony of thy truth, we may stedfastly look up to heaven, and by faith
    behold the glory that shall be revealed; and, being filled with the Holy
    Ghost, may learn to love and bless our persecutors by the example of thy
    first Martyr Saint Stephen, who prayed for his murderers to thee, O blessed
    Jesus, who standest at the right hand of God to succour all those that
    suffer for thee, our only Mediator and Advocate. Amen.
epistle_ref: Acts 7:55-end
epistle: 'STEPHEN, being full of the Holy Ghost, looked up stedfastly into
    heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the right hand
    of God, and said, Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of Man
    standing on the right hand of God. Then they cried out with a loud voice,
    and stopped their ears, and ran upon him with one accord, and cast him
    out of the city, and stoned him: and the witnesses laid down their clothes
    at a young man''s feet, whose name was Saul. And they stoned Stephen,
    calling upon God, and saying, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit. And he kneeled
    down, and cried with a loud voice, Lord, lay not this sin to their charge.
    And when he had said this, he fell asleep.'

gospel_ref: St. Matthew 23:34-end
gospel: BEHOLD, I send unto you prophets, and wise men, and scribes; and some
    of them ye shall kill and crucify; and some of them shall ye scourge in
    your synagogues, and persecute them from city to city; that upon you may
    come all the righteous blood shed upon the earth, from the blood of righteous
    Abel unto the blood of Zacharias, son of Barachias, whom ye slew between
    the temple and the altar. Verily I say unto you, All these things shall
    come upon this generation. O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the
    prophets, and stonest them which are sent unto thee; how often would I
    have gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens
    under her wings, and ye would not! Behold, your house is left unto you
    desolate. For I say unto you, Ye shall not see me henceforth, till ye
    shall say, Blessed is he that cometh in the Name of the Lord.
