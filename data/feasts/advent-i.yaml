introit: 'Unto thee, O Lord, lift I up my soul; O my God, in thee have I trusted,
    let me not be confounded: neither let mine enemies triumph over me; for
    all they that look for thee shall not be ashamed. Shew me thy ways, O
    Lord: and teach me thy paths. Glory be to the Father, and to the Son,
    and to the Holy Ghost: As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall
    be: world without end. Amen.'
collect: ALMIGHTY God, give us grace that we may cast away the works of darkness,
    and put upon us the armour of light, now in the time of this mortal life,
    in which thy Son Jesus Christ came to visit us in great humility; that
    in the last day, when he shall come again in his glorious Majesty, to
    judge both the quick and the dead, we may rise to the life immortal; through
    him who liveth and reigneth with thee and the Holy Ghost, now and ever.
    Amen.
epistle_ref: Romans 13:81-4
epistle: 'OWE no man any thing, but to love one another: for he that loveth
    another hath fulfilled the law. For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery,
    Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness,
    Thou shalt not covet; and if there be any other commandment, it is briefly
    comprehended in this saying, namely, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as
    thyself. Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore love is the fulfilling
    of the law. And that, knowing the time, that now it is high time to awake
    out of sleep: for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed. The
    night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the
    works of darkness, and let us put on the armour of light. Let us walk
    honestly, as in the day; not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering
    and wantonness, not in strife and envying. But put ye on the Lord Jesus
    Christ, and make not provision for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof.'

gospel_ref: St. Matthew 21:1-13
gospel: 'WHEN they drew nigh unto Jerusalem, and were come to Bethphage, unto
    the mount of Olives, then sent Jesus two disciples, saying unto them,
    Go into the village over against you, and straightway ye shall find an
    ass tied, and a colt with her: loose them, and bring them unto me. And
    if any man say ought unto you, ye shall say, The Lord hath need of them;
    and straightway he will send them. All this was done, that it might be
    fulfilled which was spoken by the Prophet, saying, Tell ye the daughter
    of Sion, Behold, thy King cometh unto thee, meek, and sitting upon an
    ass, and a colt the foal of an ass. And the disciples went, and did as
    Jesus commanded them; and brought the ass, and the colt, and put on them
    their clothes, and they set him thereon. And a very great multitude spread
    their garments in the way; others cut down branches from the trees, and
    strawed them in the way. And the multitudes that went before, and that
    followed, cried, saying, Hosanna to the Son of David; Blessed is he that
    cometh in the Name of the Lord; Hosanna in the Highest. And when he was
    come into Jerusalem all the city was moved, saying, Who is this? And the
    multitude said, This is Jesus the Prophet of Nazareth of Galilee. And
    Jesus went into the temple of God, and cast out all them that sold and
    bought in the temple; and overthrew the tables of the money-changers,
    and the seats of them that sold doves; and said unto them, It is written,
    My house shall be called the house of prayer; but ye have made it a den
    of thieves.'
offertory: Unto thee, O Lord, lift I up my soul; O my God, in thee have I
    trusted, let me not be confounded; neither let mine enemies triumph over
    me; for all they that look for thee shall not be ashamed.
communion: 'The Lord shall shew loving kindness: and our land shall give her
    increase.'
