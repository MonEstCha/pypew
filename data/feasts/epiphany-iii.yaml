    and was exceeding joyful, and the daughters of Juda were glad. The Lord
    is King, the earth may be glad thereof: yea, the multitude of the isles
    may be glad thereof. Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the

    without end. Amen.'

epistle_ref: Romans 12:16-end
epistle: 'BE not wise in your own conceits. Recompense to no man evil for
    evil. Provide things honest in the sight of all men. If it be possible,
    as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men. Dearly beloved,
    avenge not yourselves, but rather give place unto wrath; for it is written,
    Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord. Therefore if thine enemy
    hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink: for in so doing thou shalt
    heap coals of fire on his head. Be not overcome of evil, but overcome
    evil with good.'

gospel_ref: St. Matthew 8:1-13
gospel: 'WHEN he was come down from the mountain, great multitudes followed
    him. And behold, there came a leper and worshipped him, saying, Lord,
    if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean. And Jesus put forth his hand,
    and touched him, saying, I will; be thou clean. And immediately his leprosy
    was cleansed. And Jesus saith unto him, See thou tell no man, but go thy
    way, shew thyself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded,
    for a testimony unto them. And when Jesus was entered into Capernaum,
    there came unto him a centurion beseeching him, and saying, Lord, my servant
    lieth at home sick of the palsy, grievously tormented. And Jesus saith
    unto him, I will come and heal him. The centurion answered and said, Lord,
    I am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof; but speak the
    word only, and my servant shall be healed. For I am a man under authority,
    having soldiers under me: and I say unto this man, Go, and he goeth; and
    to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth
    it. When Jesus heard it, he marvelled, and said to them that followed,
    Verily I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no not in Israel.
    And I say unto you, That many shall come from the east and west, and shall
    sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven.
    But the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness:
    there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth. And Jesus said unto the
    centurion, Go thy way, and as thou hast believed, so be it done unto thee.
    And his servant was healed in the self-same hour.'

    and declare the works of the Lord.'
communion: 'All wondered at the gracious words: which proceeded out of his
    mouth.'
