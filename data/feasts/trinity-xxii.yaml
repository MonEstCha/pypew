introit: 'If thou, O Lord, wilt be extreme to mark iniquities, Lord, who may
    abide it: for unto thee belongeth mercy, O God of Israel. Out of the deep
    have I called unto thee, O Lord: Lord, hear my voice. Glory be to the
    Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost: As it was in the beginning,
    is now, and ever shall be: world without end. Amen.'
collect: LORD, we beseech thee to keep thy household the Church in continual
    godliness; that through thy protection it may be free from all adversities,

    through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
epistle_ref: Philippians 1:3-11
epistle: 'I THANK my God upon every remembrance of you, always in every prayer
    of mine for you all making request with joy, for your fellowship in the
    Gospel from the first day until now; being confident of this very thing,
    that he who hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day
    of Jesus Christ; even as it is meet for me to think this of you all, because
    I have you in my heart, inasmuch as both in my bonds, and in the defence
    and confirmation of the Gospel, ye all are partakers of my grace. For
    God is my record, how greatly I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus
    Christ. And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in
    knowledge and in all judgement: that ye may approve things that are excellent;
    that ye may be sincere, and without offence, till the day of Christ: being
    filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ unto
    the glory and praise of God.'

gospel_ref: St. Matthew 18:21-end
gospel: 'PETER said unto Jesus, Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against
    me, and I forgive him? till seven times? Jesus saith unto him, I say not
    unto thee, until seven times; but until seventy times seven. Therefore
    is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain king, which would take
    account of his servants. And when he had begun to reckon, one was brought
    unto him, which owed him ten thousand talents. But forasmuch as he had
    not to pay, his lord commanded him to be sold, and his wife and children,
    and all that he had, and payment to be made. The servant therefore fell
    down and worshipped him, saying, Lord, have patience with me, and I will
    pay thee all. Then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion,
    and loosed him, and forgave him the debt. But the same servant went out,
    and found one of his fellow-servants, which owed him an hundred pence;
    and he laid hands on him, and took him by the throat, saying, Pay me that
    thou owest. And his fellow-servant fell down at his feet, and besought
    him, saying, Have patience with me, and I will pay thee all. And he would
    not; but went and cast him into prison, till he should pay the debt. So
    when his fellow-servants saw what was done, they were very sorry, and
    came and told unto their lord all that was done. Then his lord, after
    that he had called him, said unto him, O thou wicked servant, I forgave
    thee all that debt, because thou desiredst me: shouldest not thou also
    have had compassion on thy fellow-servant, even as I had pity on thee?
    And his lord was wroth, and delivered him to the tormentors, till he should
    pay all that was due unto him. So likewise shall my heavenly Father do
    also unto you, if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother
    their trespasses.'

    speech in my mouth, that my words may be pleasing in thy sight.'
communion: 'I say unto you, there is joy among the Angels of God: over one
    sinner that repenteth.'
