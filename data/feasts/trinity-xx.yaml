introit: 'Everything that thou hast brought upon us, O Lord God, thou hast
    done in righteousness and judgement: for we have trespassed against thee,
    and have not obeyed thy commandments; but give glory and honour to thy
    name, and deal with us according to the multitude of thy tender mercies.
    Great is the Lord, and highly to be praised: in the city of our God, even
    upon his holy hill. Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the
    Holy Ghost: As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be: world
    without end. Amen.'
collect: O ALMIGHTY and most merciful God, of thy bountiful goodness keep
    us, we beseech thee, from all things that may hurt us; that we, being
    ready both in body and soul, may cheerfully accomplish those things that
    thou wouldest have done; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
epistle_ref: 'Ephesians 5:15-21 '
epistle: SEE then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise, redeeming
    the time, because the days are evil. Wherefore be ye not unwise, but understanding
    what the will of the Lord is. And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess;
    but be filled with the Spirit; speaking to yourselves in psalms, and hymns,
    and spiritual songs; singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord;
    giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father, in the name
    of our Lord Jesus Christ; submitting yourselves one to another in the
    fear of God.

gospel_ref: St. Matthew 22:1-14
gospel: 'JESUS said, The kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king, who
    made a marriage for his son; and sent forth his servants to call them
    that were bidden to the wedding; and they would not come. Again, he sent
    forth other servants, saying, Tell them which are bidden, Behold, I have
    prepared my dinner; my oxen and my fatlings are killed, and all things
    are ready; come unto the marriage. But they made light of it, and went
    their ways, one to his farm, another to his merchandise: and the remnant
    took his servants, and entreated them spitefully, and slew them. But when
    the king heard thereof, he was wroth; and he sent forth his armies, and
    destroyed those murderers, and burnt up their city. Then saith he to his
    servants, The wedding is ready, but they who were bidden were not worthy.
    Go ye therefore into the high-ways, and as many as ye shall find bid to
    the marriage. So those servants went out into the high-ways, and gathered
    together all, as many as they found, both bad and good; and the wedding
    was furnished with guests. And when the king came in to see the guests,
    he saw there a man which had not on a wedding-garment. And he saith unto
    him, Friend, how camest thou in hither, not having a wedding-garment?
    And he was speechless. Then said the king to the servants, Bind him hand
    and foot, and take him away, and cast him into outer darkness: there shall
    be weeping and gnashing of teeth. For many are called, but few are chosen.'
offertory: 'By the waters of Babylon we sat down and wept: when we remembered
    thee, O Sion.'
communion: 'Remember thy word unto thy servant, O Lord, wherein thou hast
    caused me to put my trust: the same is my comfort in my affliction.'
