introit: 'Whenas all the world was in profoundness quietness, and night was
    in the midst of her swift course: thine almighty word, O Lord, leaped
    down from heaven out of thy royal throne. The Lord is King, and hath put
    on glorious apparel: the Lord hath put on his apparel, and girded himself
    with strength. Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy
    Ghost: As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be: world without
    end. Amen.'
collect: 'ALMIGHTY God, who hast given us thy only-begotten Son to take our
    nature upon him, and as at this time to be born of a pure Virgin: Grant
    that we being regenerate, and made thy children by adoption and grace,
    may daily be renewed by thy Holy Spirit; through the same our Lord Jesus
    Christ, who liveth and reigneth with thee and the same Spirit, ever one
    God, world without end. Amen.'
epistle_ref: Galatians 4:1-7
epistle: 'NOW I say, that the heir, as long as he is a child, differeth nothing
    from a servant, though he be lord of all; but is under tutors and governors,
    until the time appointed of the father. Even so we, when we were children,
    were in bondage under the elements of the world: but when the fulness
    of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under
    the law, to redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive
    the adoption of sons. And because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the
    Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father. Wherefore thou
    art no more a servant, but a son; and if a son, then an heir of God through
    Christ.'

gospel_ref: St. Matthew 1:18-21
gospel: 'THE birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When as his mother Mary
    was espoused to Joseph, before they came together she was found with child
    of the Holy Ghost. Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not
    willing to make her a publick example, was minded to put her away privily.
    But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared
    unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph thou son of David, fear not to take
    unto thee Mary thy wife; for that which is conceived in her is of the
    Holy Ghost: and she shall bring forth a Son, and thou shalt call his name
    Jesus; for he shall save his people from their sins. (Now all this was
    done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet,
    saying, Behold, a Virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a
    Son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is,
    God with us.) Then Joseph, being raised from sleep, did as the angel of
    the Lord had bidden him, and took unto him his wife; and knew her not
    till she had brought forth her first-born son: and he called his name
    Jesus.'
