introit: 'Right dear, O God, are thy friends unto me, and held in highest
    honour: their rule and governance is exceeding steadfast. O Lord, thou
    hast searched me out, and known me: thou knowest my down sitting, and
    mine uprising. Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy
    Ghost. As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be: world without
    end. Amen.'
collect: GRANT, O merciful God, that as thine holy Apostle Saint James, leaving
    his father and all that he had, without delay was obedient unto the calling
    of thy Son Jesus Christ, and followed him; so we, forsaking all worldly
    and carnal affections, may be evermore ready to follow thy holy commandments;
    through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
epistle_ref: Acts 11:27-12:3
epistle: 'IN those days came prophets from Jerusalem unto Antioch. And there
    stood up one of them named Agabus, and signified by the Spirit, that there
    should be great dearth throughout all the world; which came to pass in
    the days of Claudius Caesar. Then the disciples, every man according to
    his ability, determined to send relief unto the brethren which dwelt in
    Judaea: which also they did, and sent it to the elders by the hands of
    Barnabas and Saul. Now about that time Herod the king stretched forth
    his hands to vex certain of the Church. And he killed James the brother
    of John with the sword. And because he saw it pleased the Jews, he proceeded
    further to take Peter also.'

gospel_ref: St. Matthew 20:20-28
gospel: 'THEN came to him the mother of Zebedee''s children with her sons,
    worshipping him, and desiring a certain thing of him. And he said unto
    her, What wilt thou? She saith unto him, Grant that these my two sons
    may sit, the one on thy right hand, and the other on the left, in thy
    kingdom. But Jesus answered and said, Ye know not what ye ask. Are ye
    able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of, and to be baptized with
    the baptism that I am baptized with? They say unto him, We are able. And
    he saith unto them, Ye shall drink indeed of my cup, and be baptized with
    the baptism that I am baptized with: but to sit on my right hand, and
    on my left, is not mine to give; but it shall be given to them for whom
    it is prepared of my Father. And when the ten heard it, they were moved
    with indignation against the two brethren. But Jesus called them unto
    him, and said, Ye know that the princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion
    over them, and they that are great exercise authority upon them. But it
    shall not be so among you: but whosoever will be great among you, let
    him be your minister; and whosoever will be chief among you, let him be
    your servant: even as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but
    to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.'
offertory: 'Thou shalt make them princes in all lands: they shall remember
    thy Name, O Lord, from one generation to another.'
communion: 'Ye which have followed me shall sit upon twelve thrones: judging
    the twelve tribes of Israel, saith the Lord.'
