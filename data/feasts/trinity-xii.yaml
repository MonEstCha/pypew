introit: 'Haste thee, O God, unto my rescue, and save me; O Lord, make haste
    to my deliverance: let mine enemies be ashamed and confounded, that seek
    after my soul. Let them be turned backward, and put to confusion: that
    wish me evil. Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy
    Ghost: As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be: world without
    end. Amen.'
collect: 'ALMIGHTY and everlasting God, who art always more ready to hear
    than we are to pray, and art wont to give more than either we desire or
    deserve: Pour down upon us the abundance of thy mercy; forgiving us those
    things whereof our conscience is afraid, and giving us those good things
    which we are not worthy to ask, but through the merits and mediation of
    Jesus Christ, thy Son, our Lord. Amen.'
epistle_ref: 2 Corinthians 3:4-9
epistle: 'SUCH trust have we through Christ to Godward: not that we are sufficient
    of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves; but our sufficiency is
    of God: who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament; not
    of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit
    giveth life. But if the ministration of death written and engraven in
    stones was glorious, so that the children of Israel could not stedfastly
    behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance, which glory
    was to be done away; how shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather
    glorious? For if the ministration of condemnation be glory, much more
    doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory.'

gospel_ref: St. Mark 7:31-end
gospel: 'JESUS, departing from the coasts of Tyre and Sidon, came unto the
    sea of Galilee, through the midst of the coasts of Decapolis. And they
    bring unto him one that was deaf, and had an impediment in his speech;
    and they beseech him to put his hand upon him. And he took him aside from
    the multitude, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spit, and touched
    his tongue; and looking up to heaven, he sighed, and saith unto him, Ephphatha,
    that is, Be opened. And straightway his ears were opened, and the string
    of his tongue was loosed, and he spake plain. And he charged them that
    they should tell no man: but the more he charged them, so much the more
    a great deal they published it; and were beyond measure astonished, saying,
    He hath done all things well; he maketh both the deaf to hear, and the
    dumb to speak.'
offertory: 'Moses besought the Lord his God and said: Why, O Lord, doth thy
    wrath wax hot against thy people? Turn from thy fierce wrath; remember
    Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob: to whom thou swarest to give a land flowing
    with milk and honey. And the Lord repented of the evil: which he thought
    to do unto his people.'
communion: 'The earth, O Lord, is filled with the fruit of thy works: that
    thou mayest bring food out of the earth, and wine that maketh glad the
    heart of man. And oil to make him a cheerful countenance: and bread to
    strengthen man''s heart.'
