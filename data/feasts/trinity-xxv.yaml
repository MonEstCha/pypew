    thoughts of peace, and not of affliction: ye shall call upon me, and I
    will hearken unto you, and will bring  you again in your captivity from
    every nation. Lord, thou art become gracious unto thy land: thou hast
    turned away the captivity of Jacob. Glory be to the Father, and to the
    Son, and to the Holy Ghost: As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever
    shall be: world without end. Amen.'

epistle: 'BEHOLD, the days come, saith the Lord, that I will raise unto David a
 righteous Branch, and a King shall reign and prosper, and shall execute
 judgement and justice in the earth. In his days Judah shall be saved, and
 Israel shall dwell safely: and this is his name whereby he shall be called,
 the lord our righteousness. Therefore behold, the days come, saith the Lord,
 that they shall no more say, The Lord liveth, which brought up the children of
 Israel out of the land of Egypt; but, The Lord liveth, which brought up, and
 which led the seed of the house of Israel out of the north-country, and from
 all countries whither I had driven them; and they shall dwell in their own
 land.'

gospel: >
  WHEN Jesus then lift up his eyes, and saw a great company come
  unto him, he saith unto Philip, Whence shall we buy bread that these
  may eat? (And this he said to prove him; for he himself knew what he
  would do.) Philip answered him, Two hundred penny-worth of bread is
  not sufficient for them, that every one of them may take a little. One
  of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, saith unto him, There
  is a lad here, which hath five barley-loaves, and two small fishes;
  but what are they among so many? And Jesus said, Make the men sit
  down. Now there was much grass in the place. So the men sat down, in
  number about five thousand. And Jesus took the loaves, and when he had
  given thanks, he distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to
  them that were set down; and likewise of the fishes, as much as they
  would. When they were filled, he said unto his disciples, Gather up
  the fragments that remain, that nothing be lost. Therefore they
  gathered them together, and filled twelve baskets with the fragments
  of the five barley-loaves, which remained over and above unto them
  that had eaten. Then those men, when they had seen the miracle that
  Jesus did, said, This is of a truth that Prophet that should come into
  the world.
