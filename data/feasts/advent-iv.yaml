coadvent: 21
introit: 'Remember us, O Lord, with the favour that thou bearest unto thy
    people; O visit us with thy salvation: that we, beholding the felicity
    of thy chosen, may rejoice in the gladness of thy people; and may glory
    with thine inheritance. We have sinned with our fathers: we have done
    amiss and dealt wickedly. Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and
    to the Holy Ghost: As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall
    be: world without end. Amen.'
collect: O LORD, raise up (we pray thee) thy power, and come among us, and
    with great might succour us; that whereas, through our sins and wickedness,
    we are sore let and hindered in running the race that is set before us,
    thy bountiful grace and mercy may speedily help and deliver us; through
    the satisfaction of thy Son our Lord, to whom with thee and the Holy Ghost
    be honour and glory, world without end. Amen.

    requests be made known unto God. And the peace of God, which passeth all
    understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.'

gospel_ref: St. John 1:19-28
gospel: 'THIS is the record of John, when the Jews sent Priests and Levites
    from Jerusalem to ask him, Who art thou? And he confessed, and denied
    not; but confessed, I am not the Christ. And they asked him, What then?
    Art thou Elias? And he saith, I am not. Art thou that Prophet? And he
    answered, No. Then said they unto him, Who art thou? that we may give
    an answer to them that sent us. What sayest thou of thyself? He said,
    I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way
    of the Lord, as said the prophet Esaias. And they which were sent were
    of the Pharisees. And they asked him, and said unto him, Why baptizest
    thou then, if thou be not that Christ, nor Elias, neither that Prophet?
    John answered them, saying, I baptize with water: but there standeth one
    among you, whom ye know not: he it is who coming after me is preferred
    before me, whose shoe''s latchet I am not worthy to unloose. These things
    were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing.'
offertory: 'Be strong, fear not; behold, our God will come with a recompense:
    he will come, and save us.'
