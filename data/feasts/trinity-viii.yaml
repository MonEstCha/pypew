introit: 'We have waited, O God, for thy loving-kindness in the midst of thy
    temple; according to thy Name, O God, so is thy praise unto the world''s
    end: thy right hand is full of righteousness. Great is the Lord, and highly
    to be praised: in the city of our God, even upon his holy hill. Glory
    be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost. As it was in
    the beginning, is now, and ever shall be: world without end. Amen.'
collect: O GOD, whose never-failing providence ordereth all things both in
    heaven and earth; We humbly beseech thee to put away from us all hurtful
    things, and to give us those things which be profitable for us; through
    Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
epistle_ref: Romans 8:12-17
epistle: 'BRETHEREN, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh:
    for if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die; but if ye through the Spirit
    do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live. For as many as are led
    by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God. For ye have not received
    the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the spirit of
    adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father. The Spirit itself beareth witness
    with our spirit, that we are the children of God: and if children, then
    heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ: if so be that we suffer
    with him, that we may be also glorified together.'
gat: Gradual and Alleluia Proper
gradual: 'Be thou my strong rock, and house of defence: that thou mayest save
    me. In thee, O Lord, have I put my trust: let me never be put to confusion.'
alleluia: 'Alleluia. Alleluia. Hear my law: O my people. Alleluia.'
gospel_ref: St. Matthew 7:15-21
gospel: BEWARE of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but
    inwardly they are ravening wolves. Ye shall know them by their fruits.
    Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles? Even so every good
    tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil
    fruit. A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit; neither can a corrupt
    tree bring forth good fruit. Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit
    is hewn down, and cast into the fire. Wherefore by their fruits ye shall
    know them. Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into
    the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is
    in heaven.
offertory: 'Thou shalt save the people that are in adversity, O Lord, and
    shalt bring down the high looks of the proud: for who is God, but the
    Lord?'
communion: 'O taste and see how gracious the Lord is: blessed is he that putteth
    his trust in him.'
