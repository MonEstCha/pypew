name: Easter V
coeaster: 35
introit: 'With a voice of singing declare ye this, and let it be heard, alleluia:
    utter it even unto the ends of the earth; the Lord hath delivered his
    people, alleluia, alleluia. O be joyful in God, all ye lands: sing praises
    unto the honour of his Name; make his praise to be glorious. Glory be
    to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost. As it was in the
    beginning, is now, and ever shall be: world without end. Amen.'
collect: 'O LORD, from whom all good things do come: Grant to us thy humble
    servants, that by thy holy inspiration we may think those things that
    be good, and by thy merciful guiding may perform the same; through our
    Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.'
epistle_ref: St. James 1:22-end
epistle: BE ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own
    selves. For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like
    unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass. For he beholdeth himself,
    and goeth his way, and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was.
    But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth therein,
    he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall
    be blessed in his deed. If any man among you seem to be religious, and
    bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man's religion
    is vain. Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this,
    To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself
    unspotted from the world.
gat: Alleluia Proper
alleluia: 'Alleluia. Alleluia. Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my Name:
    ask, and ye shall receive. Alleluia. Christ, being raised from the dead,
    dieth no more: death have no more dominion over him. Alleluia.'
gospel_ref: St. John 16:23-end
gospel: 'VERILY, verily I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father
    in my name, he will give it you. Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my
    name: ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full. These things
    have I spoken unto you in proverbs: the time cometh when I shall no more
    speak unto you in proverbs, but I shall shew you plainly of the Father.
    At that day ye shall ask in my name: and I say not unto you, that I will
    pray the Father for you; for the Father himself loveth you, because ye
    have loved me, and have believed that I came out from God. I came forth
    from the Father, and am come into the world: again, I leave the world,
    and go to the Father. His disciples said unto him, Lo, now speakest thou
    plainly, and speakest no proverb. Now are we sure that thou knowest all
    things, and needest not that any man should ask thee: by this we believe
    that thou camest forth from God. Jesus answered them, Do ye now believe?
    Behold, the hour cometh, yea, is now come, that ye shall be scattered
    every man to his own, and shall leave me alone: and yet I am not alone,
    because the Father is with me. These things I have spoken unto you, that
    in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation; but
    be of good cheer, I have overcome the world.'
offertory: 'O praise our God, ye people, and make the voice of his praise
    to be heard: who holdeth our soul in life, and suffereth not our feet
    to slip. Praised be God, who hath not cast out my prayer: nor turned mercy
    from me, alleluia.'
communion: 'O sing unto the Lord, alleluia: sing unto the Lord, and praise
    his Name; be telling of his salvation from day to day, alleluia, alleluia.'
