name: St. Luke the Evangelist
month: 10
day: 18
introit: 'Right dear, O God, are thy friends unto me, and held in highest
    honour: their rule and governance is exceeding steadfast. O Lord, thou
    hast searched me out, and known me: thou knowest my down sitting, and
    mine uprising. Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy
    Ghost: As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be: world without
    end. Amen.'
collect: 'ALMIGHTY God, who calledst Luke the Physician, whose praise is in
    the Gospel, to be an Evangelist, and Physician of the soul: May it please
    thee that, by the wholesome medicines of the doctrine delivered by him,
    all the diseases of our souls may be healed; through the merits of thy
    Son Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.'
epistle_ref: 2 St. Timothy 4:5-15
epistle: 'WATCH thou in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an
    Evangelist, make full proof of thy ministry. For I am now ready to be
    offered, and the time of my departure is at hand. I have fought a good
    fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith. Henceforth there
    is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous
    Judge, shall give me at that day: and not to me only, but unto all them
    also that love his appearing. Do thy diligence to come shortly unto me:
    for Demas hath forsaken me, having loved this present world, and is departed
    unto Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus unto Dalmatia. Only Luke
    is with me. Take Mark and bring him with thee: for he is profitable to
    me for the ministry. And Tychicus have I sent to Ephesus. The cloke that
    I left at Troas with Carpus, when thou comest, bring with thee; and the
    books, but especially the parchments. Alexander the copper-smith did me
    much evil: the Lord reward him according to his works. Of whom be thou
    ware also, for he hath greatly withstood our words.'

gospel_ref: St. Luke 10.1-7
gospel: 'THE Lord appointed other seventy also, and sent them two and two
    before his face into every city and place whither he himself would come.
    Therefore said he unto them, The harvest truly is great, but the labourers
    are few; pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he would send
    forth labourers into his harvest. Go your ways; behold, I send you forth
    as lambs among wolves. Carry neither purse, nor scrip, nor shoes, and
    salute no man by the way. And into whatsoever house ye enter, first say,
    Peace be to this house. And if the son of peace be there, your peace shall
    rest upon it: if not, it shall turn to you again. And in the same house
    remain, eating and drinking such things as they give: for the labourer
    is worthy of his hire.'
offertory: 'The righteous shall be joyful in the Lord, and shall put his trust
    in him: and all the upright of heart shall be thankful, alleluia, alleluia.'
communion: 'He that will come after me, let him deny himself: and take up
