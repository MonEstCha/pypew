name: Requiem Mass
introit: 'Rest eternal grant unto them, O Lord: and may light perpetual shine
    upon them. Thou, O God, art praised in Syon, and unto thee shall the vow
    be performed in Jerusalem: thou that hearest the prayer, unto thee shall
    all flesh come.'
gat: Gradual and Tract Proper
gradual: 'Rest eternal grant to them, O Lord: and may light perpetual shine
    upon them. Let their souls dwell at ease: and their seed inherit the land.'
tract: 'Like as the hart desireth the water brooks: so longeth my soul after
    thee, my God. My soul is athirst for God, yea, even for the living God:
    whan shall I come to appear before the presence of God. My tears have
    been my meat day and night: while they daily say unto me, Where is now
    thy God?'
offertory: "O Lord Jesu Christ, King of Majesty, deliver the souls of all\
    \ the faithful departed from the hand of hell; and from the pit of destruction:\
    \ deliver them from the lion\u2019s mouth; that the grave devour them\
    \ not; that they go not down to the realms of darkness. But let Michael,\
    \ the holy standard-bearer, make speed to restore them to the brightness\
    \ of glory: which thou promisedst in ages past to Abraham, and his seed.\
    \ Sacrifice and prayer do we offer unto thee, O Lord: do thou accept them\
    \ for the souls departed, in whose memory we make this oblation. And grant\
    \ them, Lord, to pass from death unto life: which thou promisedst in ages\
    \ past unto Abraham and his seed."
communion: 'May light eternal shine, O Lord, upon them: for endless ages with
    thy blessed ones, for thou art gracious. Rest eternal grant to them, O
    Lord: and may light perpetual shine upon them. For endless ages with thy
    blessed ones: for thou art gracious.'
