introit: 'Unto us a Child is born; unto us a Son is given: and the government
    shall be upon his shoulder; and his Name shall be called, Angel of mighty
    Counsel. O sing unto the Lord a new song: for he hath done marvellous
    things. Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost:
    As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be: world without end.
    Amen.'
collect: 'ALMIGHTY God, who hast given us thy only-begotten Son to take our
    nature upon him, and as at this time to be born of a pure Virgin: Grant
    that we being regenerate, and made thy children by adoption and grace,
    may daily be renewed by thy Holy Spirit; through the same our Lord Jesus
    Christ, who liveth and reigneth with thee and the same Spirit, ever one
    God, world without end. Amen.'
epistle_ref: Hebrews 1:1-12
epistle: 'GOD, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past
    unto the fathers by the prophets, hath in these last days spoken unto
    us by his Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also
    he made the worlds; who being the brightness of his glory, and the express
    image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power,
    when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of
    the Majesty on high; being made so much better than the angels, as he
    hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they. For unto
    which of the angels said he at any time, Thou art my Son, this day have
    I begotten thee? And again, I will be to him a Father, and he shall be
    to me a Son? And again, when he bringeth in the first-begotten into the
    world, he saith, And let all the angels of God worship him. And of the
    angels he saith, Who maketh his angels spirits, and his ministers a flame
    of fire. But unto the Son he saith, Thy throne, O God, is for ever and
    ever; a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of thy kingdom: Thou hast
    loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God, even thy God,
    hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows. And, Thou,
    Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth; and the
    heavens are the works of thine hands: they shall perish, but thou remainest;
    and they all shall wax old as doth a garment; and as a vesture shalt thou
    fold them up, and they shall be changed; but thou art the same, and thy
    years shall not fail.'
gat: Gradual and Alleluia Proper
gradual: 'All the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God: O
    be joyful in God, all ye lands. The Lord hath declared his salvation:
    in the sight of the heathen hath he openly shewed his righteousness.'
alleluia: 'Alleluia. Alleluia. A hallowed day hath dawned upon the earth;
    come, ye nations, and worship the Lord: for on this day a great light
    hath descended upon the earth. Alleluia.'
gospel_ref: St. John 1:1-14
gospel: 'IN the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the
    Word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things were
    made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made. In
    him was life, and the life was the light of men. And the light shineth
    in darkness, and the darkness comprehended it not. There was a man sent
    from God, whose name was John. The same came for a witness, to bear witness
    of the light, that all men through him might believe. He was not that
    light, but was sent to bear witness of that light. That was the true light,
    which lighteth every man that cometh into the world. He was in the world,
    and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not. He came unto
    his own, and his own received him not. But as many as received him, to
    them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe
    on his Name: which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh,
    nor of the will of man, but of God. And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt
    among us (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only-begotten of
    the Father) full of grace and truth.'
offertory: 'The heavens are thine, the earth also is thine; thou hast laid
    the foundations of the round world, and all that therein is: righteousness
    and equity are the habitation of thy seat.'
communion: 'Be joyful, O daughter of Sion, sing praises, O daughter of Jerusalem:
    behold, thy king cometh; he is righteous and having salvation.'
