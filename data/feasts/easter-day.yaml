introit: 'I am risen, and am still with thee, alleluia; thou hast laid thine
    hand upon me, alleluia: thy knowledge is too wonderful and excellent for
    me, alleluia, alleluia. O Lord, thou hast searched me out, and known me:
    thou knowest my down-sitting, and mine uprising. Glory be to the Father,
    and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost. As it was in the beginning, is
    now, and ever shall be: world without end. Amen. '
collect: 'ALMIGHTY God, who through thine only-begotten Son Jesus Christ hast
    overcome death, and opened unto us the gate of everlasting life: We humbly
    beseech thee, that as by thy special grace preventing us thou dost put
    into our minds good desires, so by thy continual help we may bring the
    same to good effect; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who liveth and reigneth
    with thee and the Holy Ghost, ever one God, world without end. Amen.'
epistle_ref: Colossians 3:1-7
epistle: 'IF ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above,
    where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God. Set your affection on things
    above, not on things on the earth. For ye are dead, and your life is hid
    with Christ in God. When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall
    ye also appear with him in glory. Mortify therefore your members which
    are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil
    concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry: for which things''
    sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience: in the which
    ye also walked some time, when ye lived in them.'

gospel_ref: St. John 20:1-10
gospel: THE first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalen early, when it was
    yet dark, unto the sepulchre, and seeth the stone taken away from the
    sepulchre. Then she runneth and cometh to Simon Peter, and to the other
    disciple whom Jesus loved, and saith unto them, They have taken away the
    Lord out of the sepulchre, and we know not where they have laid him. Peter
    therefore went forth, and that other disciple, and came to the sepulchre.
    So they ran both together; and the other disciple did outrun Peter, and
    came first to the sepulchre; and he, stooping down and looking in, saw
    the linen clothes lying; yet went he not in. Then cometh Simon Peter following
    him, and went into the sepulchre, and seeth the linen clothes lie; and
    the napkin that was about his head, not lying with the linen clothes,
    but wrapped together in a place by itself. Then went in also that other
    disciple which came first to the sepulchre, and he saw, and believed.
    For as yet they knew not the Scripture, that he must rise again from the
    dead. Then the disciples went away again unto their own home.

communion: 'Christ our Passover is sacrificed for us, alleluia: therefore
    let us keep the feast of the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth,
    alleluia, alleluia, alleluia.'
