introit: 'Mine eyes are ever looking unto the Lord, for he shall pluck my
    feet out of the net: look thou upon me, and have mercy upon me, for I
    am desolate, and in misery. Unto thee, O Lord, do I lift up my soul: my
    God, in thee have I trusted, let me not be confounded.'
collect: WE beseech thee, Almighty God, look upon the hearty desires of thy
    humble servants, and stretch forth the right hand of thy Majesty, to be
    our defence against all our enemies; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
epistle_ref: 1 Ephesians 5:1-14
epistle: 'BE ye therefore followers of God, as dear children; and walk in
    love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself for us, an
    offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling savour. But fornication,
    and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named amongst
    you, as becometh saints; neither filthiness, nor foolish-talking, nor
    jesting, which are not convenient; but rather giving of thanks: for this
    ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who
    is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ, and of
    God. Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these things
    cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience. Be not ye therefore
    partakers with them: for ye were sometimes darkness, but now are ye light
    in the Lord: walk as children of light; (for the fruit of the Spirit is
    in all goodness, and righteousness, and truth;) proving what is acceptable
    unto the Lord. And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness,
    but rather reprove them: for it is a shame even to speak of those things
    which are done of them in secret. But all things that are reproved are
    made manifest by the light: for whatsoever doth make manifest is light.
    Wherefore he saith, Awake, thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead,
    and Christ shall give thee light.'
gat: Gradual and Tract Proper
gradual: 'Up, Lord, and let not man have the upper hand: let the heathen be
    judged in thy sight. While mine enemies are driven back: they shall fall
    and perish at thy presence.'
tract: 'Unto thee lift I up mine eyes: O thou that dwellest in the heavens.
    Behold, even as the eyes of servants: look unto the hand of their masters.
    And as the eyes of a maiden: unto the hand of her mistress. Even so our
    eyes wait upon the Lord our God: until he have mercy upon us. Haver mercy
    upon us, O Lord: have mercy upon us.'
gospel_ref: St. Luke 11:14-28
gospel: 'JESUS was casting out a devil, and it was dumb. And it came to pass,
    when the devil was gone out, the dumb spake; and the people wondered.
    But some of them said, He casteth out devils through Beelzebub, the chief
    of the devils. And others, tempting him, sought of him a sign from heaven.
    But he, knowing their thoughts, said unto them, Every kingdom divided
    against itself is brought to desolation; and a house divided against a
    house falleth. If Satan also be divided against himself, how shall his
    kingdom stand? because ye say, that I cast out devils through Beelzebub.
    And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your sons cast them
    out? therefore shall they be your judges. But if I with the finger of
    God cast out devils, no doubt the kingdom of God is come upon you. When
    a strong man armed keepeth his palace, his goods are in peace; but when
    a stronger than he shall come upon him, and overcome him, he taketh from
    him all his armour wherein he trusted, and divideth his spoils. He that
    is not with me is against me: and he that gathereth not with me scattereth.
    When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places,
    seeking rest; and finding none, he saith, I will return unto my house
    whence I came out. And when he cometh, he findeth it swept and garnished.
    Then goeth he and taketh to him seven other spirits more wicked than himself,
    and they enter in, and dwell there; and the last state of that man is
    worse than the first. And it came to pass, as he spake these things, a
    certain woman of the company lift up her voice, and said unto him, Blessed
    is the womb that bare thee, and the paps which thou hast sucked. But he
    said, Yea rather, blessed are they that hear the word of God, and keep
    it.'
offertory: 'The statutes of the Lord are right, and rejoice the heart: sweeter
    also than honey and the honeycomb; moreover by them is thy servant taught.'
communion: 'The sparrow hath found her an house, and the swallow a nest where
    she may lay her young: even thy altars, O Lord of hosts, my King and my
    God. Blessed are they that dwell in thy house: they will be always praising
    thee.'
