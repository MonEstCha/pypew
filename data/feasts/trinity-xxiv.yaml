introit: 'Thus saith the Lord, I know the thoughts that I think towards you,
    thoughts of peace, and not of affliction: ye shall call upon me, and I
    will hearken unto you, and will bring  you again in your captivity from
    every nation. Lord, thou art become gracious unto thy land: thou hast
    turned away the captivity of Jacob. Glory be to the Father, and to the
    Son, and to the Holy Ghost: As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever
    shall be: world without end. Amen.'
collect: 'O LORD, we beseech thee, absolve thy people from their offences;

    Father, for Jesus Christ''s sake, our blessed Lord and Saviour. Amen.'

epistle: 'WE give thanks to God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying
    always for you, since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the
    love which ye have to all the saints; for the hope which is laid up for
    you in heaven, whereof ye heard before in the word of the truth of the
    Gospel; which is come unto you, as it is in all the world, and bringeth
    forth fruit, as it doth also in you, since the day ye heard of it, and
    knew the grace of God in truth. As ye also learned of Epaphras, our dear
    fellow-servant, who is for you a faithful minister of Christ; who also
    declared unto us your love in the Spirit. For this cause we also, since
    the day we heard it, do not cease to pray for you, and to desire that
    ye might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual
    understanding: that ye might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing,
    being fruitful in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of
    God; strengthened with all might, according to his glorious power, unto
    all patience and long-suffering with joyfulness; giving thanks unto the
    Father, which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of
    the saints in light.'

gospel_ref: St. Matthew 9:18-26
gospel: 'WHILE Jesus spake these things unto John''s disciples, behold, there
    came a certain ruler, and worshipped him, saying, My daughter is even
    now dead; but come and lay thy hand upon her, and she shall live. And
    Jesus arose, and followed him, and so did his disciples. (And behold,
    a woman, which was diseased with an issue of blood twelve years, came
    behind him, and touched the hem of his garment: for she said within herself,
    If I may but touch his garment, I shall be whole. But Jesus turned him
    about, and when he saw her, he said, Daughter, be of good comfort, thy
    faith hath made thee whole. And the woman was made whole from that hour.)
    And when Jesus came into the ruler''s house, and saw the minstrels and
    the people making a noise, he said unto them, Give place; for the maid
    is not dead, but sleepeth. And they laughed him to scorn. But when the
    people were put forth, he went in, and took her by the hand, and the maid
    arose. And the fame hereof went abroad into all that land.'
