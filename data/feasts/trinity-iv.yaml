introit: 'The Lord is my light, and my salvation, whom then shall I fear?
    the Lord is the stronghold of my life, of whom shall I be afraid? when
    mine enemies pressed sore against me, they stumbled and fell. Though an
    host of men were laid against me: yet shall not my heart be afraid. Glory
    be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost. As it was in
    the beginning, is now, and ever shall be: world without end. Amen.'
collect: 'O GOD, the protector of all that trust in thee, without whom nothing
    is strong, nothing is holy: Increase and multiply upon us thy mercy; that,
    thou being our ruler and guide, we may so pass through things temporal,
    that we finally lose not the things eternal: Grant this, O heavenly Father,
    for Jesus Christ''s sake our Lord. Amen.'
epistle_ref: 1 Roman 8:18-23
epistle: 'I RECKON that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy
    to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us. For the earnest
    expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons
    of God. For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but
    by reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope: because the creature
    itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the
    glorious liberty of the children of God. For we know that the whole creation
    groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now. And not only they,
    but ourselves also, which have the first-fruits of the Spirit, even we
    ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the
    redemption of our body.'
gat: Gradual and Alleluia Proper
gradual: 'Be merciful, O Lord, unto our sins: wherefore do the heathen say,
    Where is now their God? Help us, O god of our salvation: and for the honour
    of thy Name, deliver us, O Lord.'
alleluia: 'Alleluia. Alleluia. The King shall rejoice in thy strength, O Lord:
    exceeding glad shall he be of thy salvation. Alleluia.'
gospel_ref: St. Luke 6:36-42
gospel: 'BE ye therefore merciful, as your Father also is merciful. Judge
    not, and ye shall not be judged: condemn not, and ye shall not be condemned:
    forgive, and ye shall be forgiven: give, and it shall be given unto you;
    good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over, shall
    men give into your bosom. For with the same measure that ye mete withal,
    it shall be measured to you again. And he spake a parable unto them, Can
    the blind lead the blind? shall they not both fall into the ditch? The
    disciple is not above his master; but every one that is perfect shall
    be as his master. And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother''s
    eye, but perceivest not the beam that is in thine own eye? Either how
    canst thou say to thy brother, Brother, let me pull out the mote that
    is in thine eye, when thou thyself beholdest not the beam that is in thine
    own eye? Thou hypocrite, cast out first the beam out of thine own eye,
    and then shalt thou see clearly to pull out the mote that is in thy brother''s
    eye.'
offertory: Lighten mine eyes, that I sleep not in death; lest mine enemy say,
    I have prevailed against him.
communion: 'The Lord is my strong rock, and my defence: my Saviour, my God,
    and my might.'
