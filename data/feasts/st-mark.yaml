introit: 'Thou hast hidden me, O God, from the gathering together of the froward,
    alleluia: from the insurrection of the workers of iniquity, alleluia,
    alleluia. Hear my voice, O God, in my prayer: preserve my life from fear
    of the enemy. Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy
    Ghost: As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be: world without
    end. Amen.'
collect: 'O ALMIGHTY God, who hast instructed thy holy Church with the heavenly
    doctrine of thy Evangelist Saint Mark: Give us grace, that, being not
    like children carried away with every blast of vain doctrine, we may be
    established in the truth of thy holy Gospel; through Jesus Christ our
    Lord. Amen.'
epistle_ref: Ephesians 4:7-16
epistle: 'UNTO every one of us is given grace, according to the measure of
    the gift of Christ. Wherefore he saith, When he ascended up on high, he
    led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men. (Now that he ascended,
    what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the
    earth? He that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all
    heavens, that he might fill all things.) And he gave some Apostles, and
    some Prophets, and some Evangelists, and some Pastors and Teachers; for
    the perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry, for the edifying
    of the body of Christ; till we all come, in the unity of the faith and
    of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure
    of the stature of the fulness of Christ: that we henceforth be no more
    children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine,
    by the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait
    to deceive; but speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all
    things, which is the head, even Christ: from whom the whole body fitly
    joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth, according
    to the effectual working in the measure of every part, maketh increase
    of the body, unto the edifying of itself in love.'
gat: Alleluia Proper
alleluia: 'Alleluia. Alleluia. Thou hast set, O Lord: a crown of pure gold
    upon his head. Alleluia. The righteous shall be joyful in the Lord, and
    shall put his trust in him: and all the upright of heart shall be thankful.
    Alleluia.'
gospel_ref: St. John 15:1-11
gospel: 'I AM the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman. Every branch
    in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away; and every branch that beareth
    fruit, he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit. Now ye are clean
    through the word which I have spoken unto you. Abide in me, and I in you.
    As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine;
    no more can ye, except ye abide in me. I am the vine, ye are the branches.
    He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit;
    for without me ye can do nothing. If a man abide not in me, he is cast
    forth as a branch, and is withered; and men gather them, and cast them
    into the fire, and they are burned. If ye abide in me, and my words abide
    in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you. Herein
    is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so shall ye be my disciples.
    As the Father hath loved me, so have I loved you: continue ye in my love.
    If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have
    kept my Father''s commandments, and abide in his love. These things have
    I spoken unto you, that my joy might remain in you, and that your joy
    might be full.'
offertory: 'The righteous shall be joyful in the Lord, and shall put his trust
    in him: and all the upright of heart shall be thankful, alleluia, alleluia.'
communion: 'He that will come after me, let him deny himself: and take up
    his cross, and follow me, alleluia, alleluia.'
