introit: 'Bow down, O Lord, thine ear to me, and hear me: O my God, save thy 
    servant that trusteth in thee; have mercy upon me, O Lord, for I have 
    called daily upon thee. Comfort the sould of thy servant: for unto thee, 
    O Lord, do I lift up my soul. Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and 
    to the Holy Ghost: As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be: 
    world without end. Amen.'
collect: 'KEEP, we beseech thee, O Lord, thy Church with thy perpetual mercy; 
    and, because the frailty of man without thee cannot but fall, keep us ever 
    by thy help from all things hurtful, and lead us to all things profitable 
    to our salvation; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.'
epistle_ref: Galatians 6:11-18
epistle: 'YE see how large a letter I have written unto you with mine own hand. 
    As many as desire to make a fair show in the flesh, they constrain you to 
    be circumcised; only lest they should suffer persecution for the cross of 
    Christ. For neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law; but 
    desire to have you circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh. But God 
    forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, 
    by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world. For in Christ 
    Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a 
    new creature. And as many as walk according to this rule, peace be on them, 
    and mercy, and upon the Israel of God. From henceforth let no man trouble 
    me: for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus. Brethren, the grace 
    of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.'

gospel_ref: St. Matthew 6:24-end
gospel: 'NO man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and 
    love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. 
    Ye cannot serve God and Mammon. Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought 
    for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your 
    body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body 
    than raiment? Behold the fowls of the air; for they sow not, neither do 
    they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them. 
    Are ye not much better than they? Which of you by taking thought can add 
    one cubit unto his stature? And why take ye thought for raiment? Consider 
    the lilies of the field how they grow: they toil not, neither do they spin: 
    and yet I say unto you, that even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed 
    like one of these. Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, 
    which to-day is, and to-morrow is cast into the oven; shall he not much 
    more clothe you, O ye of little faith? Therefore take no thought, saying, 
    What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be 
    clothed? (For after all these things do the Gentiles seek:) for your 
    heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things. But seek ye 
    first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall 
    be added unto you. Take therefore no thought for the morrow; for the morrow 
    shall take thought for the things of itself: sufficient unto the day is the 
    evil thereof.'
offertory: 'I have waited patiently for the Lord, and he inclined unto me: he 
    heard my calling, and hath put a new song in my mouth, even a thanksgiving 
    unto our God.'
communion: 'Whoso eateth my Flesh, and drinketh my Blood: dwelleth in me, and 
    I in him, saith the Lord.'
