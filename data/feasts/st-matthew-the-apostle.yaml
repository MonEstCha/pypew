introit: 'Right dear, O God, are thy friends unto me, and held in highest
    honour: their rule and governance is exceeding steadfast. O Lord, thou
    hast searched me out, and known me: thou knowest my down sitting, and
    mine uprising. Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy
    Ghost: As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be: world without
    end. Amen.'
collect: 'O ALMIGHTY God, who by thy blessed Son didst call Matthew from the
    receipt of custom to be an Apostle and Evangelist: Grant us grace to forsake
    all covetous desires and inordinate love of riches, and to follow the
    same thy Son Jesus Christ, who liveth and reigneth with thee and the Holy
    Ghost, one God, world without end. Amen.'

epistle: 'THEREFORE seeing we have this ministry, as we have received mercy,
    we faint not; but have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, not
    walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully, but by
    manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man''s conscience
    in the sight of God. But if our Gospel be hid, it is hid to them that
    are lost: in whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them
    which believe not, lest the light of the glorious Gospel of Christ, who
    is the image of God, should shine unto them. For we preach not ourselves
    but Christ Jesus the Lord; and ourselves your servants for Jesus'' sake.
    For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined
    in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God,
    in the face of Jesus Christ.'

gospel: 'AND as Jesus passed forth from thence, he saw a man named Matthew,
    sitting at the receipt of custom: and he saith unto him, Follow me. And
    he arose, and followed him. And it came to pass, as Jesus sat at meat
    in the house, behold, many publicans and sinners came, and sat down with
    him and his disciples. And when the Pharisees saw it, They said unto his
    disciples, Why eateth your Master with publicans and sinners? But when
    Jesus heard that, he said unto them, They that be whole need not a physician,
    but they that are sick. But go ye and learn what that meaneth, I will
    have mercy, and not sacrifice: for I am not come to call the righteous,
    but sinners to repentance.'
