introit: 'Right dear, O God, are thy friends unto me, and held in highest
    honour: their rule and governance is exceeding steadfast. O Lord, thou
    hast searched me out, and known me: thou knowest my down sitting, and
    mine uprising. Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy
    Ghost: As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be: world without
    end. Amen.'
collect: 'O ALMIGHTY God, who into the place of the traitor Judas didst choose
    thy faithful servant Matthias to be of the number of the twelve Apostles:
    Grant that thy Church, being alway preserved from false Apostles, may
    be ordered and guided by faithful and true pastors; through Jesus Christ
    our Lord. Amen.'
epistle_ref: Acts 1:15-end
epistle: 'IN those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples, and
    said, (the number of the names together were about an hundred and twenty,)
    Men and brethren, this Scripture must needs have been fulfilled, which
    the Holy Ghost by the mouth of David spake before concerning Judas, which
    was guide to them that took Jesus: for he was numbered with us, and had
    obtained part of this ministry. Now this man purchased a field with the
    reward of iniquity; and falling headlong he burst asunder in the midst,
    and all his bowels gushed out. And it was known unto all the dwellers
    at Jerusalem, in so much as that field is called in their proper tongue,
    Aceldama, that is to say, The field of blood. For it is written in the
    book of Psalms, Let his habitation be desolate, and let no man dwell therein;
    and, His bishoprick let another take. Wherefore, of these men which have
    companied with us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among
    us, beginning from the baptism of John, unto that same day that he was
    taken up from us, must one be ordained to be a witness with us of his
    resurrection. And they appointed two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was
    surnamed Justus, and Matthias. And they prayed, and said, Thou, Lord,
    which knowest the hearts of all men, shew whether of these two thou hast
    chosen; that he may take part of this ministry and apostleship, from which
    Judas by transgression fell, that he might go to his own place. And they
    gave forth their lots; and the lot fell upon Matthias, and he was numbered
    with the eleven Apostles.'

gospel_ref: St. Matthew 11:25-end
gospel: 'AT that time Jesus answered and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord
    of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise
    and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes. Even so, Father, for so
    it seemed good in thy sight. All things are delivered unto me of my Father:
    and no man knoweth the Son, but the Father; neither knoweth any man the
    Father, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal him. Come
    unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.
    Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me, for I am meek and lowly in heart:
    and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden
    is light.'
