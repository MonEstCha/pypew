introit: 'Right dear, O God, are thy friends unto me, and held in highest
    honour: their rule and governance is exceeding steadfast. O Lord, thou
    hast searched me out, and known me: thou knowest my down sitting, and
    mine uprising. Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy
    Ghost: As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be: world without
    end. Amen.'
collect: 'ALMIGHTY God, who didst give such grace unto thy holy Apostle Saint
    Andrew, that he readily obeyed the calling of thy Son Jesus Christ, and
    followed him without delay: Grant unto us all, that we, being called by
    thy holy word, may forthwith give up ourselves obediently to fulfil thy
    holy commandments; through the same Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.'
epistle_ref: Romans 10:9-end
epistle: 'IF thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe
    in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.
    For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness, and with the mouth
    confession is made unto salvation. For the Scripture saith, Whosoever
    believeth on him shall not be ashamed. For there is no difference between
    the Jew and the Greek: for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that
    call upon him. For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall
    be saved. How then shall they call on him, in whom they have not believed?
    And how shall they believe in him, of whom they have not heard? And how
    shall they hear without a preacher? And how shall they preach, except
    they be sent? As it is written, How beautiful are the feet of them that
    preach the Gospel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things! But
    they have not all obeyed the Gospel. For Esaias saith, Lord, who hath
    believed our report? So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the
    word of God. But I say, Have they not heard? Yes verily, their sound went
    into all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the world. But I
    say, Did not Israel know? First Moses saith, I will provoke you to jealousy
    by them that are no people, and by a foolish nation I will anger you.
    But Esaias is very bold, and saith, I was found of them that sought me
    not; I was made manifest unto them that asked not after me. But to Israel
    he saith, All day long I have stretched forth my hands unto a disobedient
    and gainsaying people.'
gat: Gradual and Alleluia Proper
gradual: 'Their sound is gone out into all lands: and their words unto the
    ends of the world. The heavens declare the glory of God: and the firmament
    sheweth his handwork.'
alleluia: Alleluia. Alleluia. I first will say to Syon, Behold, behold them,
    and I will give to Jerusalem one that bringeth good tidings. Alleluia.
gospel_ref: St. Matthew 4:18-22
gospel: JESUS, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brethren, Simon called
    Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea, (for they were
    fishers;) and he saith unto them, Follow me; and I will make you fishers
    of men. And they straightway left their nets, and followed him. And going
    on from thence he saw other two brethren, James the son of Zebedee, and
    John his brother, in a ship with Zebedee their father, mending their nets;
    and he called them. And they immediately left the ship and their father,
    and followed him.
offertory: 'Thou shalt make them princes in all lands: they shall remember
    thy Name, O Lord, from one generation to another.'
communion: 'Ye which have followed me shall sit upon twelve thrones: judging
    the twelve tribes of Israel, saith the Lord.'
