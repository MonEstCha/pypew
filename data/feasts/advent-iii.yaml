coadvent: 14
introit: 'Rejoice ye in the Lord, and again I say, rejoice ye; let your moderation
    be known unto all men, the Lord is at hand: be careful for nothing, nor
    troubled; but in all things, by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving;
    let your requests be made known unto God. And the peace of God, which
    passeth all understanding: shall keep your hearts and minds. Glory be
    to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost: As it was in the
    beginning, is now, and ever shall be: world without end. Amen.'
collect: 'O LORD Jesu Christ, who at thy first coming didst send thy messenger
    to prepare thy way before thee: Grant that the ministers and stewards
    of thy mysteries may likewise so prepare and make ready thy way, by turning
    the hearts of the disobedient to the wisdom of the just, that at thy second
    coming to judge the world we may be found an acceptable people in thy
    sight, who livest and reignest with the Father and the Holy Spirit, ever
    one God, world without end. Amen.'
epistle_ref: 1 Corinthians 4:1-5
epistle: 'LET a man so account of us, as of the ministers of Christ, and stewards
    of the mysteries of God. Moreover, it is required in stewards, that a
    man be found faithful. But with me it is a very small thing that I should
    be judged of you, or of man''s judgement: yea, I judge not mine own self.
    For I know nothing by myself, yet am I not hereby justified; but he that
    judgeth me is the Lord. Therefore judge nothing before the time, until
    the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness,
    and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts; and then shall every
    man have praise of God.'
gat: Gradual and Alleluia Proper

gospel_ref: St. Matthew 11:2-10
gospel: 'NOW when John had heard in the prison the works of Christ, he sent
    two of his disciples, and said unto him, Art thou he that should come,
    or do we look for another? Jesus answered and said unto them, Go and shew
    John again those things which ye do hear and see: the blind receive their
    sight, and the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear,
    the dead are raised up, and the poor have the Gospel preached to them.
    And blessed is he whosoever shall not be offended in me. And as they departed,
    Jesus began to say unto the multitudes concerning John, What went ye out
    into the wilderness to see? a reed shaken with the wind? But what went
    ye out for to see? a man clothed in soft raiment? behold, they that wear
    soft clothing are in kings'' houses. But what went ye out for to see?
    a prophet? yea, I say unto you, and more than a prophet. For this is he
    of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which
    shall prepare thy way before thee.'
offertory: 'O Lord, thou art become gracious unto thy land; thou hast turned
    away the captivity of Jacob: thou hast forgiven the offence of thy people.'
communion: 'Say to them that are of a fearful heart: Be strong, fear not;
    behold, your God will come and save you.'
