introit: 'Turn thee unto me, and have mercy upon me, O Lord; for I am desolate,
    and in tribulation: look thou on mine affliction, and my travail; and
    forgive me all mine iniquities, O my God. Unto thee, O Lord, do I lift
    up my soul: my God, in thee have I trusted; let me never be confounded.
    Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost. As it was
    in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be: world without end. Amen.'
collect: O LORD, we beseech thee mercifully to hear us; and grant that we,
    to whom thou hast given an hearty desire to pray, may by thy mighty aid
    be defended and comforted in all dangers and adversities; through Jesus
    Christ our Lord. Amen.
epistle_ref: 1 St. Peter 5:5b-11
epistle: 'ALL of you be subject one to another, and be clothed with humility:
    for God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble. Humble yourselves
    therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time;
    casting all your care upon him, for he careth for you. Be sober, be vigilant;
    because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about seeking
    whom he may devour: whom resist stedfast in the faith, knowing that the
    same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world.
    But the God of all grace, who hath called us into his eternal glory by
    Christ Jesus, after that ye have suffered a while, make you perfect, stablish,
    strengthen, settle you. To him be glory and dominion for ever and ever.
    Amen.'
gat: Gradual and Alleluia Proper

    me.'

    is my stony rock, my fortress, and my Saviour. Alleluia.'
gospel_ref: St. Luke 15:1-10
gospel: THEN drew near unto him all the Publicans and sinners for to hear
    him. And the Pharisees and Scribes murmured, saying, This man receiveth
    sinners, and eateth with them. And he spake this parable unto them, saying,
    What man of you having an hundred sheep, if he lose one of them, doth
    not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness, and go after that which
    is lost, until he find it? And when he hath found it, he layeth it on
    his shoulders, rejoicing. And when he cometh home, he calleth together
    his friends and neighbours, saying unto them, Rejoice with me, for I have
    found my sheep which was lost. I say unto you, that likewise joy shall
    be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and
    nine just persons, which need no repentance. Either what woman having
    ten pieces of silver, if she lose one piece, doth not light a candle,
    and sweep the house, and seek diligently till she find it? And when she
    hath found it, she calleth her friends and her neighbours together, saying,
    Rejoice with me, for I have found the piece which I had lost. Likewise,
    I say unto you, There is joy in the presence of the angels of God over
    one sinner that repenteth.
offertory: 'They that know thy Name will put their trust in thee; for thou,
    Lord, hast never failed them that seek thee: O praise the Lord which dwelleth
    in Syon; for he forgetteth not the complaint of the poor.'
communion: 'I have called upon thee, O God, for thou shalt hear me: incline
    thine ear unto me, and hearken unto my words.'
