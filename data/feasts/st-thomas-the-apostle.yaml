introit: 'Right dear, O God, are thy friends unto me, and held in highest
    honour: their rule and governance is exceeding steadfast. O Lord, thou
    hast searched me out, and known me: thou knowest my down sitting, and
    mine uprising. Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy
    Ghost: As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be: world without
    end. Amen.'
collect: 'ALMIGHTY and everliving God, who for the more confirmation of the
    faith didst suffer thy holy Apostle Thomas to be doubtful in thy Son''s
    resurrection: Grant us so perfectly, and without all doubt, to believe
    in thy Son Jesus Christ, that our faith in thy sight may never be reproved.
    Hear us, O Lord, through the same Jesus Christ, to whom, with thee and
    the Holy Ghost, be all honour and glory, now and for evermore. Amen.'

epistle: NOW therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellow-citizens
    with the saints, and of the household of God; and are built upon the foundation
    of the Apostles and Prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner-stone;
    in whom all the building, fitly framed together, groweth unto an holy
    temple in the Lord; in whom ye also are builded together for an habitation
    of God through the Spirit.

    of men. And they straightway left their nets, and followed him. And going
    on from thence he saw other two brethren, James the son of Zebedee, and
