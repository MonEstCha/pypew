coadvent: 7
introit: 'O people of Sion, behold, the Lord is night at hand to redeem the
    nations: and in the gladness of your heart the Lord shall cause his glorious
    voice to be heard. Hear, O thou Shepherd of Israel: thou that leadest
    Joseph like a sheep. Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the
    Holy Ghost: As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be: world
    without end. Amen.'
collect: 'BLESSED Lord, who hast caused all holy Scriptures to be written
    for our learning: Grant that we may in such wise hear them, read, mark,
    learn, and inwardly digest them, that by patience and comfort of thy holy
    Word, we may embrace and ever hold fast the blessed hope of everlasting
    life, which thou hast given us in our Saviour Jesus Christ. Amen.'
epistle_ref: Romans 15:4-13
epistle: 'WHATSOEVER things were written aforetime were written for our learning;
    that we through patience and comfort of the Scriptures might have hope.
    Now the God of patience and consolation grant you to be like-minded one
    towards another, according to Christ Jesus: that ye may with one mind
    and one mouth glorify God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. Wherefore
    receive ye one another, as Christ also received us, to the glory of God.
    Now I say, that Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision for the
    truth of God, to confirm the promises made unto the fathers; and that
    the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy; as it is written, For this
    cause I will confess to thee among the Gentiles, and sing unto thy Name.
    And again he saith, Rejoice, ye Gentiles, with his people. And again,
    Praise the Lord, all ye Gentiles, and laud him, all ye people. And again,
    Esaias saith, There shall be a root of Jesse, and he that shall rise to
    reign over the Gentiles, in him shall the Gentiles trust. Now the God
    of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that ye may abound
    in hope, through the power of the Holy Ghost.'

gradual: 'Out of Sion hath God appeared: in perfect beauty. Gather my saints
    together unto me: those that have made a covenant with me with sacrifice.'

gospel_ref: St. Luke 21:25-33
gospel: 'AND there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the
    stars; and upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity, the sea
    and the waves roaring; men''s hearts failing them for fear, and for looking
    after those things which are coming on the earth: for the powers of heaven
    shall be shaken. And then shall they see the Son of Man coming in a cloud
    with power and great glory. And when these things begin to come to pass,
    then look up, and lift up your heads; for your redemption draweth nigh.
    And he spake to them a parable; Behold the fig-tree, and all the trees;
    when they now shoot forth, ye see and know of your own selves that summer
    is now nigh at hand. So likewise ye, when ye see these things come to
    pass, know ye that the kingdom of God is nigh at hand. Verily I say unto
    you, This generation shall not pass away, till all be fulfilled: heaven
    and earth shall pass away; but my words shall not pass away.'
offertory: 'Wilt not thou turn again, O God, and quicken us; that thy people
    may rejoice in thee: shew us thy mercy, O Lord; and grant us thy salvation.'
communion: 'Jerusalem, haste thee, and stand on high: and behold the joy and
    gladness that cometh unto thee from God thy Saviour.'
