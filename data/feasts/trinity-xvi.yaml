introit: 'Have mercy upon me, O Lord, for I have called daily upon thee: for
    thou, O Lord, art gracious and merciful, and plenteous in thy loving-kindness
    toward all them that call upon thee. Bow down thine ear, O Lord, and hear
    me: for I am poor and in misery. Glory be to the Father, and to the Son,
    and to the Holy Ghost: As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall
    be: world without end. Amen.'
collect: O LORD, we beseech thee, let thy continual pity cleanse and defend
    thy Church; and, because it cannot continue in safety without thy succour,
    preserve it evermore by thy help and goodness; through Jesus Christ our
    Lord. Amen.
epistle_ref: Ephesians 3:13-end
epistle: I DESIRE that ye faint not at my tribulations for you, which is your
    glory. For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus
    Christ, of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named, that he
    would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened
    with might by his Spirit in the inner man; that Christ may dwell in your
    hearts by faith; that ye, being rooted and grounded in love, may be able
    to comprehend with all saints, what is the breadth, and length, and depth,
    and height; and to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that
    ye might be filled with all the fulness of God. Now unto him that is able
    to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to
    the power that worketh in us, unto him be glory in the Church by Christ
    Jesus, throughout all ages, world without end. Amen.

gospel_ref: St. Luke 7:11-17
gospel: 'AND it came to pass the day after, that Jesus went into a city called
    Nain; and many of his disciples went with him, and much people. Now when
    he came nigh to the gate of the city, behold, there was a dead man carried
    out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow; and much people
    of the city was with her. And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion
    on her, and said unto her, Weep not. And he came and touched the bier;
    and they that bare him stood still: and he said, Young man, I say unto
    thee, Arise. And he that was dead sat up, and began to speak: and he delivered
    him to his mother. And there came a fear on all, and they glorified God,
    saying, that a great Prophet is risen up among us, and that God hath visited
    his people. And this rumour of him went forth throughout all Judaea, and
    throughout all the region round about.'
offertory: 'Look down, O Lord, to help me; let them be ashamed, and confounded

    help me.'
communion: 'O Lord, I will make mention of thy righteousness only; thou, God,
    hast taught me from my youth up until now: forsake me not, O God, in my
    old age, when I am gray-headed.'
