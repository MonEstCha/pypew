introit: 'Drop down, ye heavens, from above, and let the skies pour down righteousness:
    let the earth open, and let her bring forth salvation. And let righteousness
    spring up together: I the Lord have created it. Glory be to the Father,
    and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost. As it was in the beginning, is
    now, and ever shall be: world without end. Amen.'
collect: WE beseech thee, O Lord, pour thy grace into our hearts; that, as
    we have known the incarnation of thy Son Jesus Christ by the message of
    an angel, so by his cross and passion we may be brought unto the glory
    of his resurrection; through the same Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
epistle_ref: Isaiah 7:10-15
epistle: MOREOVER, the Lord spake again unto Ahaz, saying, Ask thee a sign
    of the Lord thy God; ask it either in the depth, or in the height above.
    But Ahaz said, I will not ask, neither will I tempt the Lord. And he said,
    Hear ye now, O house of David; Is it a small thing for you to weary men,
    but will ye weary my God also? Therefore the Lord himself shall give you
    a sign; Behold, a Virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call
    his name Immanuel. Butter and honey shall he eat, that he may know to
    refuse the evil, and choose the good.

gradual: 'Lift up your heads, O ye gates, and be ye lift up, ye everlasting
    doors: and the King of Glory shall come in. Who shall ascend unto the
    hill of the Lord, or who shall stand in his holy place: even he that hath
    clean hands, and a pure heart.'
tract: 'And the Angel came in unto her, and said: Hail, Mary, full of grace;
    the Lord is with thee.Blessed art thou among women: and blessed is the
    fruit of thy womb. The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee: and the power
    of the Highest shall overshadow thee. Therefore also that holy thing which
    shall be born of thee: shall be called the Son of God.'
