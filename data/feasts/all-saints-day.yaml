epistle_ref: Revelation 7:2-12
epistle: AND I saw another angel ascending from the east, having the seal
    of the living God; and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels,
    to whom it was given to hurt the earth, and the sea, saying, Hurt not
    the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, till we have sealed the servants
    of our God in their foreheads. And I heard the number of them which were
    sealed; and there were sealed an hundred and forty and four thousand,
    of all the tribes of the children of Israel. Of the tribe of Juda were
    sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Reuben were sealed twelve thousand.
    Of the tribe of Gad were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Aser
    were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Nepthalim were sealed twelve
    thousand. Of the tribe of Manasses were sealed twelve thousand. Of the
    tribe of Simeon were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Levi were
    sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Issachar were sealed twelve thousand.
    Of the tribe of Zabulon were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Joseph
    were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Benjamin were sealed twelve
    thousand. After this I beheld, and lo, a great multitude, which no man
    could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues, stood
    before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and
    palms in their hands; and cried with a loud voice, saying, Salvation to
    our God which sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb. And all the
    angels stood round about the throne, and about the elders, and the four
    beasts, and fell before the throne on their faces, and worshipped God,
    saying, Amen; Blessing, and glory, and wisdom, and thanksgiving, and honour,
    and power, and might, be unto our God for ever and ever. Amen.
