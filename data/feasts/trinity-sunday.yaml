    grace, by the confession of a true faith to acknowledge the glory of the
    eternal Trinity, and in the power of the Divine Majesty to worship the
    Unity: We beseech thee, that thou wouldest keep us stedfast in this faith,
    and evermore defend us from all adversities, who livest and reignest,
    one God, world without end. Amen.'
epistle_ref: Revelation 4:1-end
epistle: 'AFTER this I looked, and behold, a door was opened in heaven: and
    the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with
    me; which said, come up hither, and I will shew thee things which must
    be hereafter. And immediately I was in the Spirit; and behold, a throne
    was set in heaven, and one sat on the throne: and he that sat was to look
    upon like a jasper and a sardine stone: and there was a rainbow round
    about the throne, in sight like unto an emerald. And round about the throne
    were four and twenty seats; and upon the seats I saw four and twenty elders
    sitting, clothed in white raiment; and they had on their heads crowns
    of gold: and out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings and
    voices. And there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne,
    which are the seven spirits of God. And before the throne there was a
    sea of glass like unto crystal: and in the midst of the throne, and round
    about the throne, were four beasts full of eyes before and behind. And
    the first beast was like a lion, and the second beast like a calf, and
    the third beast had a face as a man, and the fourth beast was like a flying
    eagle. And the four beasts had each of them six wings about him; and they
    were full of eyes within: and they rest not day and night, saying, Holy,
    holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to come. And
    when those beasts give glory and honour and thanks to him that sat on
    the throne, who liveth for ever and ever, the four and twenty elders fall
    down before him that sat on the throne, and worship him that liveth for
    ever and ever, and cast their crowns before the throne, saying, Thou art
    worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honour and power; for thou hast created
    all things, and for thy pleasure they are, and were created.'

gospel_ref: St. John 3:1-15
gospel: 'THERE was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the
    Jews: the same came to Jesus by night, and said unto him, Rabbi, we know
    that thou art a teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles
    that thou doest, except God be with him. Jesus answered and said unto
    him, Verily, verily I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot
    see the kingdom of God. Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born
    when he is old? can he enter the second time into his mother''s womb,
    and be born? Jesus answered, Verily, verily I say unto thee, Except a
    man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom
    of God. That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born
    of the Spirit is spirit. Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be
    born again. The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound
    thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth; so
    is every one that is born of the Spirit. Nicodemus answered and said unto
    him, How can these things be? Jesus answered and said unto him, Art thou
    a master of Israel, and knowest not these things? Verily, verily I say
    unto thee, We speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen; and
    ye receive not our witness. If I have told you earthly things, and ye
    believe not; how shall ye believe, if I tell you of heavenly things? And
    no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven,
    even the Son of man, who is in heaven. And as Moses lifted up the serpent
    in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up: that whosoever
    believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life.'
offertory: 'Blessed be God the Father, and the only begotten Son of God; and
    blessed be the Holy Spirit: for the mercy he hath done unto us.'
communion: 'Let us bless the God of heaven; and in the sight of all living
    will we give thanks unto him: because he hath done to us-ward after his
    loving kindness.'
