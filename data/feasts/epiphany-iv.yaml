introit: 'All ye Angels of God, fall down, and worship before him: Syon heard,
    and was exceeding joyful, and the daughters of Juda were glad. The Lord
    is King, the earth may be glad thereof: yea, the multitude of the isles
    may be glad thereof. Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the
    Holy Ghost: As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be: world
    without end. Amen.'
collect: 'O GOD, who knowest us to be set in the midst of so many and great
    dangers, that by reason of the frailty of our nature we cannot always
    stand upright: Grant to us such strength and protection, as may support
    us in all dangers, and carry us through all temptations; through Jesus
    Christ our Lord. Amen.'
epistle_ref: Romans 13:1-7
epistle: 'LET every soul be subject unto the higher powers; for there is no
    power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God. Whosoever therefore
    resisteth the power resisteth the ordinance of God: and they that resist
    shall receive to themselves damnation. For rulers are not a terror to
    good works, but to the evil. Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power?
    do that which is good, and thou shalt have praise of the same: for he
    is the minister of God to thee for good. But if thou do that which is
    evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword in vain: for he is the minister
    of God, a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil. Wherefore
    ye must needs be subject, not only for wrath, but also for conscience
    sake. For for this cause pay ye tribute also; for they are God''s ministers,
    attending continually upon this very thing. Render therefore to all their
    dues; tribute to whom tribute is due, custom to whom custom, fear to whom
    fear, honour to whom honour.'

gospel_ref: St. Matthew 8:23-end
gospel: 'AND when he was entered into a ship, his disciples followed him.
    And behold, there arose a great tempest in the sea, insomuch that the
    ship was covered with the waves: but he was asleep. And his disciples
    came to him, and awoke him, saying, Lord, save us, we perish. And he saith
    unto them, Why are ye fearful, O ye of little faith? Then he arose, and
    rebuked the winds and the sea, and there was a great calm. But the men
    marvelled, saying, What manner of man is this, that even the winds and
    the sea obey him! And when he was come to the other side into the country
    of the Gergesenes, there met him two possessed with devils, coming out
    of the tombs, exceeding fierce, so that no man might pass by that way.
    And behold, they cried out, saying, What have we to do with thee, Jesus,
    thou Son of God? art thou come hither to torment us before the time? And
    there was a good way off from them an herd of many swine, feeding. So
    the devils besought him, saying, If thou cast us out, suffer us to go
    away into the herd of swine. And he said unto them, Go. And when they
    were come out, they went into the herd of swine: and behold, the whole
    herd of swine ran violently down a steep place into the sea, and perished
    in the waters. And they that kept them fled, and went their ways into
    the city, and told every thing, and what was befallen to the possessed
    of the devils. And behold, the whole city came out to meet Jesus: and
    when they saw him, they besought him that he would depart out of their
    coasts.'
