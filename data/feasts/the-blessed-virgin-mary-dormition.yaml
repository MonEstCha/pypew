month: 8
day: 15
introit: 'Rejoice we all in the Lord, keeping the feast day in honour of the
    blessed Virgin Mary: in whose Assumptions the Angels rejoice and glorify
    the Son of God. My heart is inditing of a good matter I speak of the things
    which I have made unto the King. Glory be to the Father, and to the Son,
    and to the Holy Ghost. As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall
    be: world without end. Amen.'
collect: 'FORGIVE, we beseech thee, O Lord, the offences of thy servants:
    that we, who of ourselves can do nothing that is acceptable unto thee;
    may be saved by the intercession of the Mother of thy Son our Lord: Who
    liveth and reigneth with Thee and the Holy Ghost, now and for ever. Amen.'
epistle_ref: Ecclesiasticus 24:7-15
epistle: 'IN all things I sought rest, and in the inheritance of the Lord
    shall I abide. So the Creator of all things gave me a commandment: and
    he that made me caused my tabernacle to rest, and said: Let thy dwelling
    be in Jacob, and thine inheritance in Israel: and take root in my elect.
    And so was I established in Sion, likewise in the beloved city he gave
    me rest, and in Jerusalem was my power. And I took root in an honourable
    people, even in the portion of the Lord''s inheritance, and my abode is
    in the full assembly of the Saints. I was exalted like a cedar in Libanus,
    and as a cypress tree upon the mountains of Hermon: I was exalted like
    a palm tree in En-gaddi, and as a rose plant in Jericho: as a fair olive
    tree in a pleasant field, and grew up as a plane tree by the water in
    the streets. I gave a sweet smell like cinnamon and Aspalathus: and I
    yielded a pleasant odour like the best myrrh.'

    not care that my sister hath left me to serve alone? bid her therefore
    that she help me. And Jesus answered and said unto her: Martha, Martha,
    thou art careful and troubled about many things: but one thing is needful.
    And Mary hath chosen that good part, which shall not be taken away from
    her.'
