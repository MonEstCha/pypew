introit: 'O Lord Almighty, everything is in subjection unto thee; and there
    is no man that is able to resist thy power: for thou hast created everything;
    heaven and earth, and all the wonders which under heaven''s vault are
    contained; thou art the Lord and King of all things. Blessed are those
    that are undefiled in the way: and walk in the law of the Lord. Glory
    be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost: As it was in
    the beginning, is now, and ever shall be: world without end. Amen.'
collect: Grant, we beseech thee, merciful Lord, to thy faithful people pardon
    and peace; that they may be cleansed from all their sins, and serve thee
    with a quiet mind; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
epistle_ref: Ephesians 6:10-20
epistle: 'MY brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.
    Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the
    wiles of the devil. For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against
    principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of
    this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. Wherefore take
    unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in
    the evil day, and, having done all, to stand. Stand therefore, having
    your loins girt about with truth; and having on the breast-plate of righteousness;
    and your feet shod with the preparation of the Gospel of peace; above
    all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench
    all the fiery darts of the wicked: and take the helmet of salvation, and
    the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God: praying always with
    all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with
    all perseverance, and supplication for all saints; and for me, that utterance
    may be given unto me, that I may open my mouth boldly, to make known the
    mystery of the Gospel, for which I am an ambassador in bonds; that therein
    I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak.'

gospel_ref: St. John 4:46-end
gospel: 'THERE was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum. When
    he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee, he went unto
    him, and besought him that he would come down and heal his son; for he
    was at the point of death. Then said Jesus unto him, Except ye see signs
    and wonders, ye will not believe. The nobleman saith unto him, Sir, come
    down ere my child die. Jesus saith unto him, Go thy way, thy son liveth.
    And the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken unto him, and he went
    his way. And as he was now going down, his servants met him, and told
    him, saying, Thy son liveth. Then inquired he of them the hour when he
    began to amend: and they said unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour
    the fever left him. So the father knew that it was at the same hour, in
    the which Jesus said unto him, Thy son liveth; and himself believed, and
    his whole house. This is again the second miracle that Jesus did, when
    he was come out of Judaea into Galilee.'
offertory: 'There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job: perfect
    and upright, and one that feared God. And Satan sought to tempt him: and
    power was given him by the Lord over his possessions, and over his flesh.
    And he destroyed all his substance and his sons: and he smote his flesh
    with sore boils.'
communion: 'My soul hath longed for thy salvation; and I have a good hope
    in thy word: when wilt thou be avenged of them that persecute me? They
    persecute me falsely: O be thou my help, O Lord my God.'
