epistle: 'FOR this cause I Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you Gentiles;
    if ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God, which is given
    me to you-ward: How that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery
    (as I wrote afore in few words, whereby, when ye read, ye may understand
    my knowledge in the mystery of Christ) which in other ages was not made
    known unto the sons of men, as it is now revealed unto his holy Apostles
    and Prophets by the Spirit; That the Gentiles should be fellow-heirs,
    and of the same body, and partakers of his promise in Christ, by the Gospel:
    whereof I was made a minister, according to the gift of the grace of God
    given unto me by the effectual working of his power. Unto me, who am less
    than the least of all saints, is this grace given, that I should preach
    among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ; and to make all
    men see what is the fellowship of the mystery, which from the beginning
    of the world hath been hid in God, who created all things by Jesus Christ:
    to the intent, that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly
    places might be known by the Church the manifold wisdom of God, according
    to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord: In
    whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him.'

gospel: 'WHEN Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea, in the days of Herod
    the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem, saying,
    Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for we have seen his star in
    the east, and are come to worship him. When Herod the king had heard these
    things, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him. And when he had gathered
    all the chief priests and scribes of the people together, he demanded
    of them, where Christ should be born. And they said unto him, In Bethlehem
    of Judaea: for thus it is written by the prophet, And thou, Bethlehem,
    in the land of Juda, art not the least among the princes of Juda: for
    out of thee shall come a Governor that shall rule my people Israel. Then
    Herod, when he had privily called the wise men, inquired of them diligently
    what time the star appeared. And he sent them to Bethlehem, and said,
    Go, and search diligently for the young child, and when ye have found
    him, bring me word again, that I may come and worship him also. When they
    had heard the king, they departed; and lo, the star which they saw in
    the east went before them, till it came and stood over where the young
    child was. When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great
    joy. And when they were come into the house, they saw the young child
    with Mary his mother, and fell down and worshipped him: and when they
    had opened their treasures, they presented unto him gifts; gold, and frankincense,
    and myrrh. And being warned of God in a dream that they should not return
    to Herod, they departed into their own country another way.'

    Kings of Arabia and Saba shall bring gifts: all Kings shall fall down
    before him; all nations shall do him service.'
