introit: 'I am the saving health of my people, saith the Lord God: out of
    whatsoever tribulation they shall pray to me, I will surely help them,
    and I Will be their God for ever and ever. Hear my law, O my people: incline
    your ears unto the words of my mouth. Glory be to the Father, and to the
    Son, and to the Holy Ghost: As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever
    shall be: world without end. Amen.'
collect: O GOD, forasmuch as without thee we are not able to please thee;
    Mercifully grant, that thy Holy Spirit may in all things direct and rule
    our hearts; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
epistle_ref: Ephesians 4:17-end
epistle: 'THIS I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that ye henceforth
    walk not as other Gentiles walk, in the vanity of their mind; having the
    understanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God through the
    ignorance that is in them, because of the blindness of their heart: who,
    being past feeling, have given themselves over unto lasciviousness, to
    work all uncleanness with greediness. But ye have not so learned Christ;
    if so be that ye have heard him, and have been taught by him, as the truth
    is in Jesus: that ye put off, concerning the former conversation, the
    old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts; and be renewed
    in the spirit of your mind; and that ye put on the new man, which after
    God is created in righteousness and true holiness. Wherefore, putting
    away lying, speak every man truth with his neighbour: for we are members
    one of another. Be ye angry and sin not: let not the sun go down upon
    your wrath: neither give place to the devil. Let him that stole steal
    no more; but rather let him labour, working with his hands the thing which
    is good, that he may have to give to him that needeth. Let no corrupt
    communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good to the
    use of edifying, that it may minister grace unto the hearers. And grieve
    not the Holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption.
    Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil-speaking,
    be put away from you, with all malice. And be ye kind one to another,
    tender-hearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ''s sake
    hath forgiven you.'
gat: Gradual and Alleluia Proper
gradual: 'Let my prayer be set forth in thy sight: O Lord as the incense:
    And let the lifting up of my hands: be an evening sacrifice.'
alleluia: Alleluia. Alleluia. They that put their trust in the Lord shall
    be even as the mount Syon he who dwelleth in Jerusalem may not be removed,
    but standeth fast for ever. Alleluia.
gospel_ref: St. Matthew 9:1-8
gospel: JESUS entered into a ship, and passed over, and came into his own
    city. And behold, they brought to him a man sick of the palsy, lying on
    a bed. And Jesus, seeing their faith, said unto the sick of the palsy,
    Son, be of good cheer, thy sins be forgiven thee. And behold, certain
    of the Scribes said within themselves, This man blasphemeth. And Jesus,
    knowing their thoughts, said, Wherefore think ye evil in your hearts?
    For whether is easier, to say, Thy sins be forgiven thee? or to say, Arise,
    and walk? But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth
    to forgive sins, (then saith he to the sick of the palsy,) Arise, take
    up thy bed, and go unto thine house. And he arose, and departed to his
    house. But when the multitude saw it, they marvelled, and glorified God,
    who had given such power unto men.
offertory: 'Though I walk in the midst of trouble, yet shalt thou refresh
    me, O Lord: thou shalt stretch forth thy right hand upon the furiousness
    of mine enemies, and thy right hand shall save me.'
communion: 'Thou hast charged that we shall diligently keep thy commandments:
    O that my ways were made so direct, that I might keep thy statutes.'
