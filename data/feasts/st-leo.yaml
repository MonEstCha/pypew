    thee on the solemnity of blessed Leo, thy confessor and Bishop: that like as he was
    found worthy to do thee faithful service, so by his merits and intercessions we may
    be absolved from all our sins. Through Jesus Christ, thy Son our Lord, who liveth and 
    reigneth with thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit, one God, world without end. Amen.'
