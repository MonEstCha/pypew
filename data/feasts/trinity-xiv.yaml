introit: 'Behold, O God, our defender, and look upon the face of thine Anointed:
    for one day in thy courts is better than a thousand. O how amiable are
    thy dwellings, thou lord of hosts: my soul hath a desire and longing to
    enter into the courts of the Lord. Glory be to the Father, and to the
    Son, and to the Holy Ghost: As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever
    shall be: world without end. Amen.'
collect: ALMIGHTY and everlasting God, give unto us the increase of faith,
    hope, and charity; and, that we may obtain that which thou dost promise,
    make us to love that which thou dost command; through Jesus Christ our
    Lord. Amen.
epistle_ref: Galatians 5:16-24
epistle: 'I SAY then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust
    of the flesh. For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit
    against the flesh; and these are contrary the one to the other; so that
    ye cannot do the things that ye would. But if ye be led by the Spirit,
    ye are not under the law. Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which
    are these: adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, idolatry,
    witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies,
    envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which
    I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they who
    do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God. But the fruit of
    the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness,
    faith, meekness, temperance: against such there is no law. And they that
    are Christ''s have crucified the flesh, with the affections and lusts.'

gospel_ref: St. Luke 17:11-19
gospel: 'AND it came to pass, as Jesus went to Jerusalem, that he passed through
    the midst of Samaria and Galilee. And as he entered into a certain village,
    there met him ten men that were lepers, which stood afar off: and they
    lifted up their voices, and said, Jesus, Master, have mercy on us. And
    when he saw them, he said unto them, Go, shew yourselves unto the priests.
    And it came to pass that, as they went, they were cleansed. And one of
    them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, and with a loud voice
    glorified God, and fell down on his face at his feet, giving him thanks;
    and he was a Samaritan. And Jesus answering said, Were there not ten cleansed?
    but where are the nine? There are not found that returned to give glory
    to God, save this stranger. And he said unto him, Arise, go thy way, thy
    faith hath made thee whole.'
offertory: 'The Angel of the Lord tarrieth round about them that fear him,
    and delivereth them: O taste and see how gracious the Lord is.'

    the life of the world.'
