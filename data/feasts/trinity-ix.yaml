introit: 'Behold, God is my helper; the Lord is he that upholdeth my soul:
    reward thou evil unto mine enemies; destroy them in thine anger, for thy
    righteousness sake, O Lord my strength and my defender. Save me, O God,
    for thy Name''s sake: and avenge me in thy strength. Glory be to the Father,
    and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost. As it was in the beginning, is
    now, and ever shall be: world without end. Amen.'
collect: GRANT to us, Lord, we beseech thee, the spirit to think and do always
    such things as be rightful; that we, who cannot do any thing that is good
    without thee, may by thee be enabled to live according to thy will; through
    Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
epistle_ref: 1 Corinthians 10:1-13
epistle: 'BRETHEREN, I would not that ye should be ignorant, how that all
    our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed through the sea; and
    were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud, and in the sea; and did all
    eat the same spiritual meat, and did all drink the same spiritual drink:
    for they drank of that spiritual rock that followed them; and that rock
    was Christ. But with many of them God was not well pleased; for they were
    overthrown in the wilderness. Now these things were our examples, to the
    intent we should not lust after evil things, as they also lusted. Neither
    be ye idolaters, as were some of them; as it is written, The people sat
    down to eat and drink, and rose up to play. Neither let us commit fornication,
    as some of them committed, and fell in one day three and twenty thousand.
    Neither let us tempt Christ, as some of them also tempted, and were destroyed
    of serpents. Neither murmur ye, as some of them also murmured, and were
    destroyed of the destroyer. Now all these things happened unto them for
    ensamples: and they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends
    of the world are come. Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take
    heed lest he fall. There hath no temptation taken you, but such as is
    common to man: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted
    above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to
    escape, that ye may be able to bear it.'

gospel_ref: St. Luke 16:1-9
gospel: 'JESUS said unto his disciples, There was a certain rich man which
    had a steward; and the same was accused unto him that he had wasted his
    goods. And he called him, and said unto him, How is it that I hear this
    of thee? Give an account of thy stewardship; for thou mayest be no longer
    steward. Then the steward said within himself, What shall I do? for my
    lord taketh away from me the stewardship: I cannot dig, to beg I am ashamed.
    I am resolved what to do, that, when I am put out of the stewardship,
    they may receive me into their houses. So he called every one of his lord''s
    debtors unto him, and said unto the first, How much owest thou unto my
    lord? And he said, An hundred measures of oil. And he said unto him, Take
    thy bill, and sit down quickly, and write fifty. Then said he to another,
    And how much owest thou? And he said, An hundred measures of wheat. And
    he said unto him, Take thy bill, and write four-score. And the lord commended
    the unjust steward, because he had done wisely: for the children of this
    world are in their generation wiser than the children of light. And I
    say unto you, Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness,
    that when ye fail, they may receive you into everlasting habitations.'
offertory: 'The statutes of the Lord are right, and rejoice the heart: sweeter
    also than honey, and the honeycomb; moreover, by them is thy servant taught.'
communion: 'Seek ye first of all the kingdom of God: and all these things
    shall be added unto you, saith the Lord.'
