introit: 'Consider, O Lord, and hear me, when I cry unto thee: be thou my
    succour, O cast me not away, neither forsake me utterly, O God of my salvation.
    The Lord is my light, and my salvation: whom then shall I fear? Glory
    be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost. As it was in
    the beginning, is now, and ever shall be: world without end. Amen.'
collect: GRANT, O Lord, we beseech thee, that the course of this world may
    be so peaceably ordered by thy governance, that thy Church may joyfully
    serve thee in all godly quietness; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
epistle_ref: 1 St. Peter 3:8-15a
epistle: 'BE ye all of one mind, having compassion one of another, love as
    brethren, be pitiful, be courteous; not rendering evil for evil, or railing
    for railing: but contrariwise blessing; knowing that ye are thereunto
    called, that ye should inherit a blessing. For he that will love life,
    and see good days, let him refrain his tongue from evil, and his lips
    that they speak no guile: let him eschew evil, and do good; let him seek
    peace, and ensue it. For the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous,
    and his ears are open unto their prayers: but the face of the Lord is
    against them that do evil. And who is he that will harm you, if ye be
    followers of that which is good? But and if ye suffer for righteousness''
    sake, happy are ye: and be not afraid of their terror, neither be troubled;
    but sanctify the Lord God in your hearts.'

gospel_ref: St. Luke 5:1-11
gospel: 'IT came to pass that as the people pressed upon him to hear the word
    of God, he stood by the lake of Gennesaret, and saw two ships standing
    by the lake; but the fishermen were gone out of them, and were washing
    their nets. And he entered into one of the ships, which was Simon''s,
    and prayed him that he would thrust out a little from the land: and he
    sat down, and taught the people out of the ship. Now when he had left
    speaking, he said unto Simon, Launch out into the deep, and let down your
    nets for a draught. And Simon answering said unto him, Master, we have
    toiled all the night, and have taken nothing; nevertheless, at thy word
    I will let down the net. And when they had this done, they inclosed a
    great multitude of fishes, and their net brake. And they beckoned unto
    their partners which were in the other ship, that they should come and
    help them. And they came, and filled both the ships, so that they began
    to sink. When Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at Jesus'' knees, saying,
    Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord. For he was astonished,
    and all that were with him, at the draught of the fishes which they had
    taken; and so was also James, and John, the sons of Zebedee, which were
    partners with Simon. And Jesus said unto Simon, Fear not, from henceforth
    thou shalt catch men. And when they had brought their ships to land, they
    forsook all, and followed him.'
