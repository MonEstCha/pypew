introit: 'Unto us a Child is born; unto us a Son is given: and the government
    shall be upon his shoulder; and his Name shall be called, Angel of mighty
    Counsel. O sing unto the Lord a new song: for he hath done marvellous
    things. Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost:
    As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be: world without end.
    Amen.'
collect: ALMIGHTY God, who madest thy blessed Son to be circumcised, and obedient
    to the law for man; Grant us the true circumcision of the Spirit; that,
    our hearts, and all our members, being mortified from all worldly and
    carnal lusts, we may in all things obey thy blessed will; through the
    same thy Son Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
epistle_ref: 'Romans 4: 8-14'
epistle: 'BLESSED is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin. Cometh
    this blessedness then upon the circumcision only, or upon the uncircumcision
    also? For we say, that faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness.
    How was it then reckoned? when he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision?
    Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision. And he received the sign of
    circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet
    being uncircumcised; that he might be the father of all them that believe,
    though they be not circumcised; that righteousness might be imputed unto
    them also: And the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision
    only, but also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham,
    which he had being yet uncircumcised. For the promise, that he should
    be the heir of the world, was not to Abraham, or to his seed, through
    the law, but through the righteousness of faith. For if they which are
    of the law be heirs, faith is made void, and the promise made of none
    effect.'
gat: Gradual and Alleluia Proper

gospel_ref: St. Luke 2:15-21
gospel: AND it came to pass, as the angels were gone  away from them into
    heaven, the shepherds said one to another, Let us now go even unto Bethlehem,
    and see this thing which is come to pass, which the Lord hath made known
    unto us. And they came with haste, and found Mary and Joseph, and the
    babe lying in a manger. And when they had seen it, they made known abroad
    the saying which was told them concerning this child. And all they that
    heard it wondered at those things which were told them by the shepherds.
    But Mary kept all these things, and pondered them in her heart. And the
    shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things that
    they had heard and seen, as it was told unto them. And when eight days
    were accomplished for the circumcising of the child, his name was called
    Jesus, which was so named of the angel before he was conceived in the
    womb.
offertory: 'The heavens are thine, the earth also is thine; thou hast laid
    the foundations of the round world, and all that therein is: righteousness
    and equity are the habitation of thy seat.'
communion: 'Be joyful, O daughter of Sion, sing praises, O daughter of Jerusalem:
