introit: 'Rejoice ye with Jerusalem; and be ye glad for her, all ye that delight
    in her: exult and sing for joy with her, all ye that in sadness mourn
    for her; that ye may suck, and be satisfied with the breasts of her consolations.
    I was glad when they said unto me: We will go into the house of the Lord.'
collect: GRANT, we beseech thee, Almighty God, that we, who for our evil deeds
    do worthily deserve to be punished, by the comfort of thy grace may mercifully
    be relieved; through our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. Amen.
epistle_ref: Galatians 4:21-end
epistle: 'TELL me, ye that desire to be under the law, do ye not hear the
    law? For it is written, that Abraham had two sons, the one by a bond-maid,
    the other by a free-woman. But he who was of the bond-woman was born after
    the flesh; but he of the free-woman was by promise. Which things are an
    allegory: for these are the two covenants; the one from the mount Sinai,
    which gendereth to bondage, which is Agar. For this Agar is mount Sinai
    in Arabia, and answereth to Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage
    with her children. But Jerusalem which is above is free; which is the
    mother of us all. For it is written, Rejoice, thou barren that bearest
    not; break forth and cry, thou that travailest not: for the desolate hath
    many more children than she which hath an husband. Now we, brethren, as
    Isaac was, are the children of promise. But as then he that was born after
    the flesh persecuted him that was born after the Spirit; even so it is
    now. Nevertheless, what saith the Scripture? Cast out the bond-woman and
    her son; for the son of the bond-woman shall not be heir with the son
    of the free-woman. So then, brethren, we are not children of the bond-woman,
    but of the free.'
gat: Gradual and Tract Proper
gradual: 'I was glad when they said unto me: we will go into the house of
    the Lord. Peace be within thy walls: and plenteousness within thy palaces.'
tract: 'They that put their trust in the Lord, shall be even as the mount
    Syon: which may not be removed, but standeth fast for ever. The hills
    stand about Jerusalem: even so standeth the Lord round about his people,
    from this time forth for evermore.'
gospel_ref: St. John 6:1-14
gospel: 'JESUS went over the sea of Galilee, which is the sea of Tiberias.
    And a great multitude followed him, because they saw his miracles which
    he did on them that were diseased. And Jesus went up into a mountain,
    and there he sat with his disciples. And the Passover, a feast of the
    Jews, was nigh. When Jesus then lift up his eyes, and saw a great company
    come unto him, he saith unto Philip, Whence shall we buy bread, that these
    may eat? (And this he said to prove him; for he himself knew what he would
    do.) Philip answered him, Two hundred penny-worth of bread is not sufficient
    for them, that every one of them may take a little. One of his disciples,
    Andrew, Simon Peter''s brother, saith unto him, There is a lad here, which
    hath five barley-loaves, and two small fishes: but what are they among
    so many? And Jesus said, Make the men sit down. Now there was much grass
    in the place. So the men sat down, in number about five thousand. And
    Jesus took the loaves, and when he had given thanks, he distributed to
    the disciples, and the disciples to them that were set down; and likewise
    of the fishes, as much as they would. When they were filled, he said unto
    his disciples, Gather up the fragments that remain, that nothing be lost.
    Therefore they gathered them together, and filled twelve baskets with
    the fragments of the five barley-loaves, which remained over and above
    unto them that had eaten. Then those men, when they had seen the miracle
    that Jesus did, said, This is of a truth that Prophet that should come
    into the world.'
offertory: 'O praise the Lord, for the Lord is gracious; O sing praises unto
    his Name, for it is lovely: whatsoever the Lord pleased, that did he in
    heaven and in earth.'
communion: 'Jerusalem is built as a city that is at unity in itself: for thither
    the tribes go up, even the tribes of the Lord, to give thanks unto the
    Name of the Lord.'
