introit: 'O praise the Lord, all ye his Angels: excelling in power, that execute
    his commandment, and hearken unto the voice of his words. Praise the Lord,
    O my soul: and all that is within me praise his holy Name. Glory be to
    the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost: As it was in the beginning,
    is now, and ever shall be: world without end. Amen.'
collect: 'O EVERLASTING God, who hast ordained and constituted the services
    of Angels and men in a wonderful order: Mercifully grant that, as thy
    holy Angels alway do thee service in heaven, so by thy appointment they
    may succour and defend us on earth; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.'
epistle_ref: Revelation 12:7-12
epistle: 'THERE was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the
    dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels, and prevailed not, neither
    was their place found any more in heaven. And the great dragon was cast
    out, that old serpent, called the devil and Satan, which deceiveth the
    whole world; he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast
    out with him. And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come salvation,
    and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ:
    for the accuser of our brethren is cast down, which accused them before
    our God day and night. And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb,
    and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto
    the death. Therefore rejoice, ye heavens, and ye that dwell in them. Woe
    to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea: for the devil is come down
    unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short
    time.'

gospel_ref: St. Matthew 18:1-10
gospel: 'AT the same time came the disciples unto Jesus, saying, Who is the
    greatest in the kingdom of heaven? And Jesus called a little child unto
    him, and set him in the midst of them, and said, Verily I say unto you,
    Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter
    into the kingdom of heaven. Whosoever there-fore shall humble himself
    as this little child, the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven. And
    whoso shall receive one such little child in my name, receiveth me. But
    whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it were
    better for him that a mill-stone were hanged about his neck, and that
    he were drowned in the depth of the sea. Woe unto the world because of
    offences: for it must needs be that offences come: but woe to that man
    by whom the offence cometh. Wherefore if thy hand or thy foot offend thee,
    cut them off, and cast them from thee: it is better for thee to enter
    into life halt or maimed, rather than having two hands or two feet to
    be cast into everlasting fire. And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it
    out, and cast it from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life with
    one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell-fire. Take heed
    that ye despise not one of these little ones; for I say unto you, that
    in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my Father which is
    in heaven.'
offertory: 'An Angel stood by the altar of the temple, having a golden cnser
    in his hand: And there was given unto him much incense, and the smoke
    of the incense ascended up to God, alleluia. '
communion: 'O ye Angels of the Lord, bless ye the Lord: sing ye praises, and
