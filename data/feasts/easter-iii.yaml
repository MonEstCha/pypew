introit: 'O be joyful in God, all ye lands, alleluia; sing praises unto
    the honour of his Name, alleluia: make his praise to be exceeding glorious,
    alleluia, alleluia, alleluia. Say unto God, O how wonderful art thou in
    thy works, O Lord: through the greatness of thy power. Glory be to the
    Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost. As it was in the beginning,
    is now, and ever shall be: world without end. Amen.'
collect: 'ALMIGHTY God, who shewest to them that be in error the light of
    thy truth, to the intent that they may return into the way of righteousness:
    Grant unto all them that are admitted into the fellowship of Christ''s
    religion, that they may eschew those things that are contrary to their
    profession, and follow all such things as are agreeable to the same; through
    our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.'
epistle_ref: 1 St. Peter 2:11-17
epistle: 'DEARLY beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, abstain
    from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul; having your conversation
    honest among the Gentiles; that, whereas they speak against you as evildoers,
    they may, by your good works which they shall behold, glorify God in the
    day of visitation. Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the
    Lord''s sake; whether it be to the king, as supreme; or unto governors,
    as unto them that are sent by him, for the punishment of evildoers, and
    for the praise of them that do well. For so is the will of God, that with
    well-doing ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men: as free,
    and not using your liberty for a cloke of maliciousness; but as the servants
    of God. Honour all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honour the king.'
gat: Alleluia Proper
alleluia: 'Alleluia. Alleluia. A little while, and ye shall not see me, saith
    the Lord Jesus: and again, a little while and ye shall see me, because
    I go to the Father. Alleluia. But I will see you again, and your heart
    shall rejoice: and your joy no man taketh from you. Alleluia.'
gospel_ref: St. John 16:16-22
gospel: 'JESUS said to his disciples, A little while and ye shall not see
    me; and again a little while and ye shall see me; because I go to the
    Father. Then said some of his disciples among themselves, What is this
    that he saith unto us, A little while and ye shall not see me; and again
    a little while and ye shall see me; and, Because I go to the Father? They
    said therefore, What is this that he saith, A little while? we cannot
    tell what he saith. Now Jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him,
    and said unto them, Do ye inquire among yourselves of that I said, A little
    while and ye shall not see me; and again a little while and ye shall see
    me? Verily, verily I say unto you, that ye shall weep and lament, but
    the world shall rejoice: and ye shall be sorrowful, but your sorrow shall
    be turned into joy. A woman, when she is in travail, hath sorrow, because
    her hour is come: but as soon as she is delivered of the child, she remembereth
    no more the anguish, for joy that a man is born into the world. And ye
    now therefore have sorrow: but I will see you again, and your heart shall
    rejoice, and your joy no man taketh from you.'
offertory: 'Praise the Lord, O my soul; while I live will I praise the Lord:
    yea, as long as I have any being, I will sing praises unto my God, alleluia.'
communion: 'A little while, and ye shall not see me, alleluia: and again,
    a little while and ye shall see me, because I go to the Father, alleluia,
    alleluia.'
