introit: 'But as for us, it behoveth us to glory in the Cross of our Lord
    Jesus Christ: in whom is our salvation, our life, and resurrection: by
    whom we were saved, and obtained our freedom. God be merciful unto us,
    and bless us: and shew us the light of his countenance, and be merciful
    unto us. '
collect: 'Almighty and Everlasting God, who, of thy tender love towards mankind,
    hast sent thy Son our Saviour Jesus Christ, to take upon him our flesh,
    and to suffer death upon the cross, that all mankind should follow the
    example of his great humility: Mercifully grant, that we may both follow
    the example of his patience, and also be made partakers of his resurrection;
    through the same Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.'
epistle_ref: 1 Corinthians 11:17-end
epistle: 'IN this that I declare unto you, I praise you not; that ye come
    together not for the better, but for the worse. For first of all, when
    ye come together in the church, I hear that there be divisions among you,
    and I partly believe it. For there must be also heresies among you, that
    they who are approved may be made manifest among you. When ye come together
    therefore into one place, this is not to eat the Lord''s supper: for in
    eating every one taketh before other his own supper; and one is hungry,
    and another is drunken. What, have ye not houses to eat and to drink in?
    or despise ye the church of God, and shame them that have not? What shall
    I say to you? shall I praise you in this? I praise you not. For I have
    received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, That the Lord
    Jesus, the same night in which he was betrayed, took bread; and when he
    had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take, eat; this is my body, which
    is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me. After the same manner
    also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the new
    testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance
    of me. For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew
    the Lord''s death till he come. Wherefore, whosoever shall eat this bread,
    and drink this cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body
    and blood of the Lord. But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat
    of that bread, and drink of that cup. For he that eateth and drinketh
    unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the
    Lord''s body. For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many
    sleep. For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged. But when
    we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned
    with the world. Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat,
    tarry one for another. And if any man hunger, let him eat at home; that
    ye come not together unto condemnation. And the rest will I set in order
    when I come.'

gradual: 'Christ became obedient for our sakes unto death, even the death
    of the Cross. Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him: and given him
    a Name which is above every name.'
gospel_ref: St. John 13:1-17
gospel: "Now before the feast of the passover, when Jesus knew that his hour\
    \ was come that he should depart out of this world unto the Father, having\
    \ loved his own which were in the world, he loved them unto the end. And\
    \ supper being ended, the devil having now put into the heart of Judas\
    \ Iscariot, Simon\u2019s son, to betray him; Jesus knowing that the Father\
    \ had given all things into his hands, and that he was come from God,\
    \ and went to God; he riseth from supper, and laid aside his garments;\
    \ and took a towel, and girded himself. After that he poureth water into\
    \ a bason, and began to wash the disciples\u2019 feet, and to wipe them\
    \ with the towel wherewith he was girded. Then cometh he to Simon Peter:\
    \ and Peter saith unto him, Lord, dost thou wash my feet? Jesus answered\
    \ and said unto him, What I do thou knowest not now; but thou shalt know\
    \ hereafter. Peter saith unto him, Thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus\
    \ answered him, If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me. Simon Peter\
    \ saith unto him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head.\
    \ Jesus saith to him, He that is washed needeth not save to wash his feet,\
    \ but is clean every whit: and ye are clean, but not all. For he knew\
    \ who should betray him; therefore said he, Ye are not all clean. So after\
    \ he had washed their feet, and had taken his garments, and was set down\
    \ again, he said unto them, Know ye what I have done to you? Ye call me\
    \ Master and Lord: and ye say well; for so I am. If I then, your Lord\
    \ and Master, have washed your feet; ye also ought to wash one another\u2019\
    s feet. For I have given you an example, that ye should do as I have done\
    \ to you. Verily, verily, I say unto you, The servant is not greater than\
    \ his lord; neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him. If\
    \ ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them."
offertory: 'The right hand of the Lord hath the pre-eminence, the right hand
    of the Lord bringeth mighty things to pass: I shall not die, but live;
    and declare the works of the Lord.'
communion: 'The Lord Jesus, after he had supped with his disciples, and had
    washed their feet, said unto them: Know ye what I your Lord and Master
    have done to you? I have given you an example, that ye should do as I
    have done for you.'
