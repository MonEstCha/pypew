introit: 'From the womb of my mother the Lord hath called me by my name; and
    hath made my mouth as it were a sharp sword: beneath the shadow of his
    hand hath he hidden me, and hath made me like to a polish''d arrow. It
    is a good thing to give thanks unto the Lord: and to sing praises unto
    thy Name, O Most Highest. Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and
    to the Holy Ghost: As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall
    be: world without end. Amen.'
collect: 'ALMIGHTY God, by whose providence thy servant John Baptist was wonderfully
    born, and sent to prepare the way of thy Son our Saviour, by preaching
    of repentance: Make us so to follow his doctrine and holy life, that we
    may truly repent according to his preaching; and after his example constantly
    speak the truth, boldly rebuke vice, and patiently suffer for the truth''s
    sake; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.'
epistle_ref: Isaiah 40:1-11
epistle: 'COMFORT ye, comfort ye my people, saith your God. Speak ye comfortably
    to Jerusalem, and cry unto her, that her warfare is accomplished, that
    her iniquity is pardoned: for she hath received of the Lord''s hand double
    for all her sins. The voice of him that crieth in the wilderness, Prepare
    ye the way of the Lord, make straight in the desert a high-way for our
    God. Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill shall
    be made low, and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough places
    plain. And the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall
    see it together: for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it. The voice said,
    Cry. And he said, What shall I cry? All flesh is grass, and all the goodliness
    thereof is as the flower of the field. The grass withereth, the flower
    fadeth, because the Spirit of the Lord bloweth upon it: surely the people
    is grass. The grass withereth, the flower fadeth; but the word of our
    God shall stand for ever. O Zion, that bringest good tidings, get thee
    up into the high mountain: O Jerusalem, that bringest good tidings, lift
    up thy voice with strength; lift it up, be not afraid: say unto the cities
    of Judah, Behold your God. Behold, the Lord God will come with strong
    hand, and his arm shall rule for him: behold, his reward is with him,
    and his work before him. He shall feed his flock like a shepherd; he shall
    gather the lambs with his arm, and carry them in his bosom, and shall
    gently lead those that are with young.'

gospel_ref: St. Luke 1:57-end
gospel: 'ELISABETH''s full time came that she should be delivered; and she
    brought forth a son. And her neighbours and her cousins heard how the
    Lord had shewed great mercy upon her; and they rejoiced with her. And
    it came to pass, that on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child;
    and they called him Zacharias, after the name of his father. And his mother
    answered and said, Not so; but he shall be called John. And they said
    unto her, there is none of thy kindred that is called by this name. And
    they made signs to his father, how he would have him called. And he asked
    for a writing-table, and wrote, saying, His name is John. And they marvelled
    all. And his mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue loosed, and
    he spake, and praised God. And fear came on all that dwelt round about
    them; and all these sayings were noised abroad throughout all the hill-country
    of Judaea. And all they that had heard them laid them up in their hearts,
    saying, What manner of child shall this be? And the hand of the Lord was
    with him. And his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Ghost, and
    prophesied, saying, Blessed be the Lord God of Israel: for he hath visited
    and redeemed his people, and hath raised up an horn of salvation for us
    in the house of his servant David; as he spake by the mouth of his holy
    prophets, which have been since the world began; that we should be saved
    from our enemies, and from the hand of all that hate us; to perform the
    mercy promised to our fathers, and to remember his holy covenant; the
    oath which he sware to our father Abraham, that he would grant unto us,
    that we, being delivered out of the hands of our enemies, might serve
    him without fear, in holiness and righteousness before him all the days
    of our life. And thou, child, shalt be called the Prophet of the Highest:
    for thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways; to
    give knowledge of salvation unto his people, by the remission of their
    sins, through the tender mercy of our God, whereby the day-spring from
    on high hath visited us; to give light to them that sit in darkness and
    in the shadow of death; to guide our feet into the way of peace. And the
    child grew, and waxed strong in spirit; and was in the deserts till the
    day of his shewing unto Israel.'
offertory: 'The righteous shall flourish like a palm tree: and shall spread
    abroad like a cedar in Libanus.'
communion: 'And thou, child, shalt be called the Prophet of the Highest: for
    thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways.'
