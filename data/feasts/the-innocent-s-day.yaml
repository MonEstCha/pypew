introit: 'Out of the mouth of very babes, O God, and of sucklings, hast thou
    perfected praise: because of thine adversaries. O Lord, our Governour:
    how excellent is thy Name in all the world. Glory be to the Father, and
    to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost: As it was in the beginning, is now,
    and ever shall be: world without end. Amen.'
collect: 'O ALMIGHTY God, who out of the mouths of babes and sucklings hast
    ordained strength, and madest infants to glorify thee by their deaths:
    Mortify and kill all vices in us, and so strengthen us by thy grace, that
    by the innocency of our lives, and constancy of our faith, even unto death,
    we may glorify thy holy Name; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.'
epistle_ref: Revelation 14:1-5
epistle: 'I LOOKED, and lo, a Lamb stood on the mount Sion, and with him an
    hundred forty and four thousand, having his Father''s Name written in
    their foreheads. And I heard a voice from heaven, as the voice of many
    waters, and as the voice of a great thunder: and I heard the voice of
    harpers harping with their harps: and they sung as it were a new song
    before the throne, and before the four beasts, and the elders; and no
    man could learn that song, but the hundred and forty and four thousand,
    which were redeemed from the earth. These are they which were not defiled
    with women, for they are virgins: these are they which follow the Lamb
    whithersoever he goeth: these were redeemed from among men, being the
    first-fruits unto God, and to the Lamb. And in their mouth was found no
    guile; for they are without fault before the throne of God.'

gospel_ref: St. Matthew 2:13-18
gospel: THE Angel of the Lord appeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise,
    and take the young child, and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be
    thou there until I bring thee word; for Herod will seek the young child
    to destroy him. When he arose, he took the young child and his mother
    by night, and departed into Egypt, and was there until the death of Herod;
    that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet,
    saying, Out of Egypt have I called my Son. Then Herod, when he saw that
    he was mocked of the wise men, was exceeding wroth; and sent forth, and
    slew all the children that were in Bethlehem, and in all the coasts thereof,
    from two years old and under, according to the time which he had diligently
    inquired of the wise men. Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by
    Jeremy the prophet, saying, In Rama was there a voice heard, lamentation,
    and weeping, and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children, and
    would not be comforted, because they are not.
