introit: 'All ye Angels of God, fall down, and worship before him: Syon heard,
    and was exceeding joyful, and the daughters of Juda were glad. The Lord
    is King, the earth may be glad thereof: yea, the multitude of the isles
    may be glad thereof. Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the
    Holy Ghost: As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be: world
    without end. Amen.'
collect: O LORD, we beseech thee to keep thy Church and household continually
    in thy true religion; that they who do lean only upon the hope of thy
    heavenly grace may evermore be defended by thy mighty power; through Jesus
    Christ our Lord. Amen.
epistle_ref: Colossians 3:12-17
epistle: PUT on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of
    mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, long-suffering; forbearing
    one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel against
    any; even as Christ forgave you, so also do ye. And above all these things
    put on charity, which is the bond of perfectness. And let the peace of
    God rule in your hearts, to the which also ye are called in one body;
    and be ye thankful. Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all
    wisdom, teaching and admonishing one another in psalms, and hymns, and
    spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord. And whatsoever
    ye do, in word or deed, do all in the Name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks
    to God and the Father by him.

gospel_ref: St. Matthew 13:24-30
gospel: 'THE kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed
    in his field. But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among
    the wheat, and went his way. But when the blade was sprung up, and brought
    forth fruit, then appeared the tares also. So the servants of the householder
    came, and said unto him, Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field?
    from whence then hath it tares? He said unto them, An enemy hath done
    this. The servants said unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather
    them up? But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root
    up also the wheat with them. Let both grow together until the harvest;
    and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together
    first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the
    wheat into my barn.'
