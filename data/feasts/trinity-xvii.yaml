epistle_ref: 'Ephesians 4:1-6 '
epistle: I THEREFORE the prisoner of the Lord beseech you, that ye walk worthy
    of the vocation wherewith ye are called, with all lowliness and meekness,
    with long-suffering, forbearing one another in love; endeavouring to keep
    the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace. There is one body, and one
    Spirit, even as ye are called in one hope of your calling; one Lord, one
    faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all, who is above all, and through
    all, and in you all.
gat: Gradual and Alleluia Proper

    folk that he hath chosen to him to be his inheritance. By the Word of
    the Lord were the heavens made and all the hosts of them by the breath
    of his mouth.'
alleluia: 'Alleluia. Alleluia. The right hand of the Lord bringeth mighty
    things to pass: the right hand of the Lord hath the pre-eminence. Alleluia.'
gospel_ref: St. Luke 14:1-11
gospel: 'IT came to pass, as Jesus went into the house of one of the chief
    Pharisees to eat bread on the sabbath-day, that they watched him. And
    behold, there was a certain man before him which had the dropsy. And Jesus
    answering spake unto the Lawyers and Pharisees, saying, Is it lawful to
    heal on the sabbath-day? And they held their peace. And he took him, and
    healed him, and let him go; and answered them, saying, Which of you shall
    have an ass, or an ox, fallen into a pit, and will not straightway pull
    him out on the sabbath-day? And they could not answer him again to these
    things. And he put forth a parable to those which were bidden, when he
    marked how they chose out the chief rooms, saying unto them, When thou
    art bidden of any man to a wedding, sit not down in the highest room;
    lest a more honourable man than thou be bidden of him; and he that bade
    thee and him come and say to thee, Give this man place; and thou begin
    with shame to take the lowest room. But when thou art bidden, go and sit
    down in the lowest room; that, when he that bade thee cometh, he may say
    unto thee, Friend, go up higher: then shalt thou have worship in the presence
    of them that sit at meat with thee. For whosoever exalteth himself shall
    be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.'
offertory: 'I, Daniel, prayed unto the Lord my God, and said: Hear, O our
    God, the prayer of thy servant. Cause thy face to shine upon thy sanctuary:
    and behold, O God, this thy people, who are called by thy Name.'
communion: 'Promise unto the Lord your God, and keep it: all ye that are round
    about him bring presents unto him that ought to be feared. He shall refrain
    the spirit of princes: and is wonderful among the kings of the earth.'
