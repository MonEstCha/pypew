introit: 'Consider, O Lord, and hear me, when I cry unto thee: be thou my
    succour, O cast me not away, neither forsake me utterly, O God of my salvation.
    The Lord is my light, and my salvation: whom then shall I fear? GGlory
    be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost. As it was in
    the beginning, is now, and ever shall be: world without end. Amen.'
collect: 'O GOD the King of glory, who hast exalted thine only Son Jesus Christ
    with great triumph unto thy kingdom in heaven: We beseech thee, leave
    us not comfortless; but send to us thine Holy Ghost to comfort us, and
    exalt us unto the same place whither our Saviour Christ is gone before,
    who liveth and reigneth with thee and the Holy Ghost, one God, world without
    end. Amen.'
epistle_ref: 1 St. Peter 4:7-11
epistle: 'THE end of all things is at hand; be ye therefore sober, and watch
    unto prayer. And above all things have fervent charity among yourselves:
    for charity shall cover the multitude of sins. Use hospitality one to
    another without grudging. As every man hath received the gift, even so
    minister the same one to another, as good stewards of the manifold grace
    of God. If any man speak, let him speak as the oracles of God: if any
    man minister, let him do it as of the ability which God giveth; that God
    in all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom be praise
    and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.'
gat: Alleluia Proper

    on his holy seat. Alleluia. I will not leave you comfortless: I go away
    and come again unto you, and your heart shall rejoice. Alleluia.'
gospel_ref: St. John 15:26-16:4
gospel: 'WHEN the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father,
    even the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father, he shall testify
    of me: and ye also shall bear witness, because ye have been with me from
    the beginning. These things have I spoken unto you, that ye should not
    be offended. They shall put you out of the synagogues: yea, the time cometh,
    that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth God service. And these
    things will they do unto you, because they have not known the Father,
    nor me. But these things have I told you, that, when the time shall come,
    ye may remember that I told you of them.'
offertory: 'Praise the Lord, O my soul, while I live will I praise the Lord:
    as long as I have any being I will sing praises unto my God, alleluia.'
communion: 'Father, while I was with them in the world, I kept those that
    thou gavest me, alleluia: and now I come to thee. I pray thee not that

    them from the evil, alleluia, alleluia.'
