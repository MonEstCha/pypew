    thee on the solemnity of blessed Athanasius, thy confessor and Bishop: that like 
    as he was found worthy to do thee faithful service, so by his merits and intercession 
    we may be absolved from all our sins. Through Jesus Christ, thy Son our Lord, who 
    liveth and reigneth with thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit, one God, world without 
    end. Amen.'
