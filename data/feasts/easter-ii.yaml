introit: 'The loving-kindness of the Lord filleth the whole world, alleluia:
    by the word of the Lord the heavens were stablished, alleluia, alleluia.
    Rejoice in the Lord, O ye righteous: for it becometh well the just to
    be thankful. Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost.
    As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be: world without end.
    Amen.'
collect: 'ALMIGHTY God, who hast given thine only Son to be unto us both a
    sacrifice for sin, and also an ensample of godly life: Give us grace that
    we may always most thankfully receive that his inestimable benefit, and
    also daily endeavour ourselves to follow the blessed steps of his most
    holy life; through the same Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.'
epistle_ref: 1 St. Peter 2:19-end
epistle: 'THIS is thank-worthy, if a man for conscience toward God endure
    grief, suffering wrongfully. For what glory is it, if, when ye be buffeted
    for your faults, ye shall take it patiently? but if, when ye do well,
    and suffer for it, ye take it patiently; this is acceptable with God.
    For even hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered for us,
    leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps: who did no sin,
    neither was guile found in his mouth: who, when he was reviled, reviled
    not again; when he suffered, he threatened not; but committed himself
    to him that judgeth righteously: who his own self bare our sins in his
    own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness:
    by whose stripes ye were healed. For ye were as sheep going astray; but
    are now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls.'

gospel_ref: St. John 10:11-16
gospel: 'JESUS said, I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his
    life for the sheep. But he that is an hireling, and not the shepherd,
    whose own the sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep,
    and fleeth; and the wolf catcheth them, and scattereth the sheep. The
    hireling fleeth, because he is an hireling, and careth not for the sheep.
    I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of mine. As the
    Father knoweth me, even so know I the Father: and I lay down my life for
    the sheep. And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold; them also
    I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold,
    and one shepherd.'
offertory: 'O God, thou art my God, early will I seek thee: and lift up my
    hands in thy Name, alleluia.'
communion: 'I am the good Shepherd, alleluia: and known my sheep, and am known
    of mine, alleluia, alleluia.'
