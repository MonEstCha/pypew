introit: 'He shall call upon me, and I will hearken unto him; I will deliver
    him, and bring him to honour: with length of days will I satisfy him.
    Whoso dwelleth under the defence of the Mosth High: shall abide under
    the shadow of the Almighty. '
collect: 'O LORD, who for our sake didst fast forty days and forty nights:
    Give us grace to use such abstinence, that, our flesh being subdued to
    the Spirit, we may ever obey thy godly motions in righteousness and true
    holiness, to thy honour and glory, who livest and reignest with the Father
    and the Holy Ghost, one God, world without end. Amen.'
epistle_ref: 2 Corinthians 6:1-10
epistle: 'WE then, as workers together with him, beseech you also, that ye
    receive not the grace of God in vain; (for he saith, I have heard thee
    in a time accepted, and in the day of salvation have I succoured thee:
    behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation;)
    giving no offence in any thing, that the ministry be not blamed; but in
    all things approving ourselves as the ministers of God, in much patience,
    in afflictions, in necessities, in distresses, in stripes, in imprisonments,
    in tumults, in labours, in watchings, in fastings; by pureness, by knowledge,
    by long-suffering, by kindness, by the Holy Ghost, by love unfeigned,
    by the word of truth, by the power of God; by the armour of righteousness
    on the right hand and on the left; by honour and dishonour, by evil report
    and good report; as deceivers, and yet true; as unknown, and yet well
    known; as dying, and behold, we live; as chastened, and not killed; as
    sorrowful, yet alway rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having
    nothing, and yet possessing all things.'
gat: Gradual and Tract Proper
gradual: 'He shall give his Angels charge over thee: to keep thee in all thy
    ways. They shall bear thee in their hands: that thou hurt not thy foot
    against a stone.'
tract: 'Whoso dwelleth under the defence of the Most High, shall abide under
    the shadow of the Almighty. I will say unto the LORD, Thou art my hope,
    and my stronghold; my God, in him will I trust. For he shall deliver thee
    from the snare of the hunter, and from the noisome pestilence. He shall
    defend thee under his wings, and thou shalt be safe under his feathers;
    his faithfulness and truth shall be thy shield and buckler. Thou shalt
    not be afraid for any terror by night, nor for the arrow that flieth by
    day; For the pestilence that walketh in darkness, nor for the sickness
    that destroyeth in the noon-day. A thousand shall fall beside thee, and
    ten thousand at thy right hand; but it shall not come nigh thee. Yea,
    with thine eyes shalt thou behold, and see the reward of the ungodly.
    For thou, LORD, art my hope; thou hast set thine house of defence very
    high. There shall no evil happen unto thee, neither shall any plague come
    nigh thy dwelling. For he shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep
    thee in all thy ways. They shall bear thee in their hands, that thou hurt
    not thy foot against a stone. Thou shalt go upon the lion and adder: the
    young lion and the dragon shalt thou tread under thy feet. Because he
    hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver him; I will set him
    up, because he hath known my Name. He shall call upon me, and I will hear
    him; yea, I am with him in trouble; I will deliver him, and bring him
    to honour. With long life will I satisfy him, and show him my salvation.'
gospel_ref: St. Matthew 4:1-11
gospel: THEN was Jesus led up of the Spirit into the wilderness, to be tempted
    of the devil. And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was
    afterward an-hungred. And when the tempter came to him, he said, If thou
    be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread. But he answered
    and said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every
    word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God. Then the devil taketh him
    up into the holy city, and setteth him on a pinnacle of the temple, and
    saith unto him, If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down; for it is
    written, He shall give his angels charge concerning thee, and in their
    hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against
    a stone. Jesus said unto him, It is written again, Thou shalt not tempt
    the Lord thy God. Again, the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high
    mountain, and sheweth him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory
    of them; and saith unto him, All these things will I give thee, if thou
    wilt fall down and worship me. Then saith Jesus unto him, Get thee hence,
    Satan; for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him
    only shalt thou serve. Then the devil leaveth him, and behold, angels
    came and ministered unto him.
offertory: 'He shall defend thee under his wings, and thou shalt be safe under
    his feathers: his faithfulness and truth shall be thy shield and buckler.'
communion: 'Whoso drinketh of the water that I shall give him, saith the Lord:
    it shall be in him a well fo water springing up unto life eternal.'
