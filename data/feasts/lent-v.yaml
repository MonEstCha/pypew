introit: 'Give sentence with me, O God, and defend the cause of my soul against
    the ungodly people: deliver me, and rid me from the deceitful and wicked
    man; for thou, O Lord, art my God, and my salvation. O send out thy light
    and thy truth, that they may lead me: and bring me unto thy holy hill,
    and to thy dwelling.'
collect: WE beseech thee, Almighty God, mercifully to look upon thy people;
    that by thy great goodness they may be governed and preserved evermore,
    both in body and soul; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
epistle_ref: Hebrews 9:11-15
epistle: CHRIST being come an High Priest of good things to come, by a greater
    and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands; that is to say, not
    of this building; neither by the blood of goats and calves; but by his
    own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal
    redemption for us. For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes
    of an heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth to the purifying of the
    flesh; how much more shall the blood of Christ, who, through the eternal
    Spirit, offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from
    dead works to serve the living God? And for this cause he is the Mediator
    of the new testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the
    transgressions that were under the first testament, they which are called
    might receive the promise of eternal inheritance.
gat: Gradual and Tract Proper
gradual: 'Deliver me, O Lord, from mine enemies: teach me to do the thing
    that pleaseth me. It is the Lord that delivereth me from my cruel enemies,
    and setteth me above mine adversaries: thou shalt deliver me from the
    wicked man.'
tract: 'Many a time have they fought against me: from my youth up. May Israel
    now say: yea, many a time have they vexed me from my youth up. But they
    have not prevailed against me: the plowers ploughed upon my back. And
    made long furrows: but the righteous Lord hath hewn the snares of the
    ungodly in pieces.'
gospel_ref: St. John 8:49-end
gospel: 'JESUS said, Which of you convinceth me of sin? and if I say the truth,
    why do ye not believe me? He that is of God heareth God''s words; ye therefore
    hear them not, because ye are not of God. Then answered the Jews, and
    said unto him, Say we not well, that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a
    devil? Jesus answered, I have not a devil; but I honour my Father, and
    ye do dishonour me. And I seek not mine own glory; there is one that seeketh
    and judgeth. Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keep my saying,
    he shall never see death. Then said the Jews unto him, Now we know that
    thou hast a devil: Abraham is dead, and the prophets; and thou sayest,
    If a man keep my saying, he shall never taste of death. Art thou greater
    than our father Abraham, which is dead? and the prophets are dead: whom
    makest thou thyself? Jesus answered, If I honour myself, my honour is
    nothing; it is my Father that honoureth me, of whom ye say, that he is
    your God: yet ye have not known him; but I know him: and if I should say,
    I know him not, I shall be a liar like unto you; but I know him, and keep
    his saying. Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day, and he saw it,
    and was glad. Then said the Jews unto him, Thou art not yet fifty years
    old, and hast thou seen Abraham? Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily,
    I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am. Then took they up stones to
    cast at him: but Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple.'
offertory: 'I will give thanks unto the Lord with my whole heart: O do well
    unto thy servant, that I may live, and keep thy word: quicken thou me,
    according to thy word, O Lord.'
communion: 'This is my Body, which is given for you; this cup is the new Testament
    in my Blood, saith the Lord: this is do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in
    remembrance of me.'
