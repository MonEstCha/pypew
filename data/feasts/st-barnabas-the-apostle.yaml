introit: 'Right dear, O God, are thy friends unto me, and held in highest
    honour: their rule and governance is exceeding steadfast. O Lord, thou
    hast searched me out, and known me: thou knowest my down sitting, and
    mine uprising. Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy
    Ghost: As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be: world without
    end. Amen.'
collect: 'O LORD God Almighty, who didst endue thy holy Apostle Barnabas with
    singular gifts of the Holy Ghost: Leave us not, we beseech thee, destitute
    of thy manifold gifts, nor yet of grace to use them alway to thy honour
    and glory; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.'
epistle_ref: Acts 11:22-end
epistle: 'TIDINGS of these things came unto the ears of the church which was
    in Jerusalem; and they sent forth Barnabas, that he should go as far as
    Antioch. Who, when he came, and had seen the grace of God, was glad; and
    exhorted them all, that with purpose of heart they would cleave unto the
    Lord. For he was a good man, and full of the Holy Ghost and of faith:
    and much people was added unto the Lord. Then departed Barnabas to Tarsus,
    for to seek Saul. And when he had found him, he brought him unto Antioch.
    And it came to pass, that a whole year they assembled themselves with
    the Church, and taught much people: and the disciples were called Christians
    first in Antioch. And in these days came prophets from Jerusalem unto
    Antioch. And there stood up one of them named Agabus, and signified by
    the Spirit, that there should be great dearth throughout all the world;
    which came to pass in the days of Claudius Caesar. Then the disciples,
    every man according to his ability, determined to send relief unto the
    brethren which dwelt in Judaea: which also they did, and sent it to the
    elders by the hands of Barnabas and Saul.'

gospel_ref: St. John 15:12-16
gospel: 'THIS is my commandment, that ye love one another, as I have loved
    you. Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life
    for his friends. Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you.
    Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth not what his
    lord doeth: but I have called you friends; for all things that I have
    heard of my Father I have made known unto you. Ye have not chosen me,
    but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth
    fruit, and that your fruit should remain: that whatsoever ye shall ask
    of the Father in my name, he may give it you.'

    thy Name, O Lord, from one generation to another.'

    the twelve tribes of Israel, saith the Lord.'
