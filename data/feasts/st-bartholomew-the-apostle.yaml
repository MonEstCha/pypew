introit: 'Right dear, O God, are thy friends unto me, and held in highest
    honour: their rule and governance is exceeding steadfast. O Lord, thou
    hast searched me out, and known me: thou knowest my down sitting, and
    mine uprising. Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy
    Ghost: As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be: world without
    end. Amen.'
collect: 'O ALMIGHTY and everlasting God, who didst give to thine Apostle
    Bartholomew grace truly to believe and to preach thy Word: Grant, we beseech
    thee, unto thy Church, to love that Word which he believed, and both to
    preach and receive the same; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.'
epistle_ref: Acts 5:12-16
epistle: 'BY the hands of the Apostles were many signs and wonders wrought
    among the people: (and they were all with one accord in Solomon''s porch:
    and of the rest durst no man join himself to them: but the people magnified
    them: and believers were the more added to the Lord, multitudes both of
    men and women:) insomuch that they brought forth the sick into the streets,
    and laid them on beds and couches, that at the least the shadow of Peter
    passing by might overshadow some of them. There came also a multitude
    out of the cities round about unto Jerusalem, bringing sick folks, and
    them which were vexed with unclean spirits; and they were healed every
    one.'

gospel_ref: St. Luke 22:24-30
gospel: 'AND there was also a strife among them, which of them should be accounted
    the greatest. And he said unto them, The kings of the Gentiles exercise
    lordship over them; and they that exercise authority upon them are called
    benefactors. But ye shall not be so: but he that is greatest among you,
    let him be as the younger; and he that is chief, as he that doth serve.
    For whether is greater, he that sitteth at meat, or he that serveth? is
    not he that sitteth at meat? but I am among you as he that serveth. Ye
    are they which have continued with me in my temptations. And I appoint
    unto you a kingdom, as my Father hath appointed unto me; that ye may eat
    and drink at my table in my kingdom, and sit on thrones judging the twelve
    tribes of Israel.'
offertory: 'Thou shalt make them princes in all lands: they shall remember
    thy Name, O Lord, from one generation to another.'
communion: 'Ye which have followed me shall sit upon twelve thrones: judging
    the twelve tribes of Israel, saith the Lord.'
