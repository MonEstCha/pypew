introit: "Thou hast mercy on all things, O Lord, and hatest nothing that thou\
    \ hast created: and winkest at men\u2019s iniquities, because they should\
    \ amend, and sparest all men, for they are thine, O Lord, thou lover of\
    \ souls. Be merciful unto me, O God, be merciful unto me: for my soul\
    \ trusteth in thee. "
collect: 'ALMIGHTY and everlasting God, who hatest nothing that thou hast
    made, and dost forgive the sins of all them that are penitent: Create
    and make in us new and contrite hearts, that we worthily lamenting our
    sins, and acknowledging our wretchedness, may obtain of thee, the God
    of all mercy, perfect remission and forgiveness; through Jesus Christ
    our Lord. Amen.'
epistle_ref: Joel 2:12-17
epistle: 'TURN ye even to me, saith the Lord, with all your heart, and with
    fasting, and with weeping, and with mourning. And rend your heart, and
    not your garments, and turn unto the Lord your God: for he is gracious
    and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and repenteth him
    of the evil. Who knoweth if he will return, and repent, and leave a blessing
    behind him, even a meat-offering and a drink-offering unto the Lord your
    God? Blow the trumpet in Zion, sanctify a fast, call a solemn assembly,
    gather the people, sanctify the congregation, assemble the elders, gather
    the children, and those that suck the breasts; let the bridegroom go forth
    of his chamber, and the bride out of her closet; let the priests, the
    ministers of the Lord, weep between the porch and the altar, and let them
    say, Spare thy people, O Lord, and give not thine heritage to reproach,
    that the heathen should rule over them: wherefore should they say among
    the people, Where is their God?'
gat: Gradual and Tract Proper
gradual: 'Be merciful unto me, O God, be merciful unto me: for my soul trusteth
    in thee. He shall send from heaven: and save me from the reproof of him
    that would eat me up.'
tract: "O Lord, deal not with us after our sins: nor reward us according to\
    \ our wickednesses. O Lord, remember not our old sins, but have mercy\
    \ upon us, and that soon: for we are come to great misery. Help us, O\
    \ God of our salvation, for the glory of thy Name, O Lord: O deliver us\
    \ and be merciful unto our sins, for thy Name\u2019s sake."
gospel_ref: St. Matthew 6:16-21
gospel: 'WHEN ye fast, be not as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance: for
    they disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to fast. Verily
    I say unto you, They have their reward. But thou, when thou fastest, anoint
    thine head, and wash thy face, that thou appear not unto men to fast,
    but unto thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father, which seeth in
    secret, shall reward thee openly. Lay not up for yourselves treasures
    upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break
    through and steal: but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where
    neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through
    nor steal: for where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.'
offertory: 'I will magnify thee, O Lord, for thou hast set me up, and not
    made my foes to triumph over me: O Lord my God, I cried unto thee, and
    thou hast healed me.'
communion: 'He who doth meditate on the law of the Lord day and night: will
    bring forth his fruit in due season.'
