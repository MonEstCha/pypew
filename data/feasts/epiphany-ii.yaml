introit: 'All the earth shall worship thee, O God, and sing of thee: they
    shall sing praise to thy Name, O most Highest. O be joyful in God, all
    ye lands: sing praises unto the honour of his Name; make his praise to
    be glorious. Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost:
    As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be: world without end.
    Amen.'
collect: 'ALMIGHTY and everlasting God, who dost govern all things in heaven
    and earth: Mercifully hear the supplications of thy people, and grant
    us thy peace all the days of our life; through Jesus Christ our Lord.
    Amen.'

epistle: 'HAVING then gifts differing according to the grace that is given
    to us, whether prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion of
    faith; or ministry, let us wait on our ministering; or he that teacheth,
    on teaching; or he that exhorteth, on exhortation: he that giveth, let
    him do it with simplicity; he that ruleth, with diligence; he that sheweth
    mercy, with cheerfulness. Let love be without dissimulation. Abhor that
    which is evil, cleave to that which is good. Be kindly affectioned one
    to another with brotherly love, in honour preferring one another: not
    slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord; rejoicing in
    hope; patient in tribulation; continuing instant in prayer; distributing
    to the necessity of saints; given to hospitality. Bless them which persecute
    you; bless, and curse not. Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep
    with them that weep. Be of the same mind one towards another. Mind not
    high things, but condescend to men of low estate.'

gospel: 'AND the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee, and the
    mother of Jesus was there. And both Jesus was called, and his disciples,
    to the marriage. And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus saith
    unto him, They have no wine. Jesus saith unto her, Woman, what have I
    to do with thee? mine hour is not yet come. His mother saith unto the
    servants, Whatsoever he saith unto you, do it. And there were set there
    six water-pots of stone, after the manner of the purifying of the Jews,
    containing two or three firkins apiece. Jesus saith unto them, Fill the
    water-pots with water. And they filled them up to the brim. And he saith
    unto them, Draw out now, and bear unto the governor of the feast. And
    they bare it. When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was
    made wine, and knew not whence it was, (but the servants which drew the
    water knew,) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom, and saith
    unto him, Every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine, and when
    men have well drunk, then that which is worse: but thou hast kept the
    good wine until now. This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee,
    and manifested forth his glory, and his disciples believed on him.'
offertory: 'O be joyful in God, all ye lands; sing praises unto the honour
    of his Name: O come hither, and hearken, all ye that fear God; and I will
    tell you what the Lord hath done for my soul, alleluia.'
communion: 'The Lord said unto them: Fill the water-pots with water, and bare
    unto the governor of the feast. When the ruler of the feast had tasted
    the water that was made wine, he saith unto the bridgreoom: Thou hast
    kept the good wine until now. This beginning of miracles: did Jesus before
    his disciples.'
