introit: 'Now I know of a surety that the Lord hath sent his Angel: and hath
    delivered me from the hand of Herod, and from all the expectation of the
    people of the Jews. And when Peter was come to himself: he said. Glory
    be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost: As it was in
    the beginning, is now, and ever shall be: world without end. Amen.'
collect: 'O ALMIGHTY God, who by thy Son Jesus Christ didst give to thy Apostle
    Saint Peter many excellent gifts, and commandedst him earnestly to feed
    thy flock: Make, we beseech thee, all Bishops and Pastors diligently to
    preach thy holy Word, and the people obediently to follow the same, that
    they may receive the crown of everlasting glory; through Jesus Christ
    our Lord. Amen.'
epistle_ref: Acts 12:1-11
epistle: 'ABOUT that time Herod the king stretched  forth his hands to vex
    certain of the Church. And he killed James the brother of John with the
    sword. And because he saw it pleased the Jews, he proceeded further to
    take Peter also. (Then were the days of unleavened bread.) And when he
    had apprehended him, he put him in prison, and delivered him to four quaternions
    of soldiers to keep him, intending after Easter to bring him forth to
    the people. Peter therefore was kept in prison; but prayer was made without
    ceasing of the Church unto God for him. And when Herod would have brought
    him forth, the same night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound
    with two chains; and the keepers before the door kept the prison. And
    behold, the angel of the Lord came upon him, and a light shined in the
    prison; and he smote Peter on the side, and raised him up, saying, Arise
    up quickly. And his chains fell off from his hands. And the angel said
    unto him, Gird thyself, and bind on thy sandals: and so he did. And he
    saith unto him, Cast thy garment about thee, and follow me. And he went
    out and followed him; and wist not that it was true which was done by
    the angel; but thought he saw a vision. When they were past the first
    and the second ward, they came unto the iron gate that leadeth unto the
    city, which opened to them of his own accord; and they went out, and passed
    on through one street, and forthwith the angel departed from him. And
    when Peter was come to himself, he said, Now I know of a surety, that
    the Lord hath sent his angel, and hath delivered me out of the hand of
    Herod, and from all the expectation of the people of the Jews.'

gospel: 'WHEN Jesus came into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his
    disciples, saying, Whom do men say that I, the Son of man, am? And they
    said, Some say that thou art John the Baptist, some Elias, and others
    Jeremias, or one of the prophets. He saith unto them, But whom say ye
    that I am? And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art Christ, the Son
    of the living God. And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou,
    Simon Bar-jona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but
    my Father which is in heaven. And I say also unto thee, that thou art
    Peter, and upon this rock I will build my Church; and the gates of hell
    shall not prevail against it. And I will give unto thee the keys of the
    kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound
    in heaven; and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in
