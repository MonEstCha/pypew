    the Holy Ghost, livest and reignest, world without end. Amen'
epistle_ref: 1 Corinthians 11:23-29
epistle: 'FOR I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto
    you, that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took
    bread: And when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take, eat:
    this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me.
    After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying,
    this cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink
    it, in remembrance of me. For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink
    this cup, ye do shew the Lord''s death till he come. Wherefore whosoever
    shall eat this bread, and drink this cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall
    be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord. But let a man examine himself,
    and so let him eat of that bread, and drink of that cup. For he that eateth
    and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not
    discerning the Lord''s body.'
