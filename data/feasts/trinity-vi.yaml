introit: 'The Lord is the strength of his people, and a stronghold of salvation
    to his Anointed One: O Lord, save thine own people, and give thy blessing
    unto thine inheritance; O feed them also, and set them up for ever. Unto
    thee will I cry, O Lord; my God, be not silent unto me: lest, if thou
    make as though thou hearest not, I become like them that go down into
    the pit. Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost.
    As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be: world without end.
    Amen.'
collect: 'O GOD, who hast prepared for them that love thee such good things
    as pass man''s understanding: Pour into our hearts such love toward thee,
    that we, loving thee above all things, may obtain thy promises, which
    exceed all that we can desire; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.'
epistle_ref: Romans 6:3-11
epistle: 'KNOW ye not that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ
    were baptized into his death? Therefore we are buried with him by baptism
    into death; that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory
    of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life. For if
    we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be
    also in the likeness of his resurrection: knowing this, that our old man
    is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth
    we should not serve sin. For he that is dead is freed from sin. Now if
    we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him; knowing
    that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more; death hath no more
    dominion over him. For in that he died, he died unto sin once; but in
    that he liveth, he liveth unto God. Likewise reckon ye also yourselves
    to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our
    Lord.'
gat: Gradual and Alleluia Proper
gradual: 'Turn thee again, O Lord, at the last: and be gracious unto thy servants.
    Lord, thou hast been our refuge: from one generation to another.'

gospel_ref: St. Matthew 5:20-26
gospel: 'JESUS said unto his disciples, Except your righteousness shall exceed
    the righteousness of the Scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter
    into the kingdom of heaven. Ye have heard that it was said by them of
    old time, Thou shalt not kill: and whosoever shall kill, shall be in danger
    of the judgement. But I say unto you, that whosoever is angry with his
    brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgement: and whosoever
    shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council: but
    whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell-fire. Therefore
    if thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother
    hath ought against thee; leave there thy gift before the altar, and go
    thy way, first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy
    gift. Agree with thine adversary quickly, whiles thou art in the way with
    him; lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge, and the
    judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison. Verily
    I say unto thee, Thou shalt by no means come out thence, till thou hast
    paid the uttermost farthing.'
offertory: 'O hold thou my goings in thy paths, that my footsteps slip not;
    incline thine ear unto me, and hearken unto my words: show thy marvellous
    loving kindness: thou that art the Saviour of them which put their trust
    in thee, O Lord.'
communion: 'I will offer in his dwelling an oblation with great gladness:
    I will sing,  and speak praises unto the Lord.'
