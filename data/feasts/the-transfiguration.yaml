collect: 'O GOD, who in the glorious Transfiguration of thine only-begotten
    Son didst confirm the mysteries of the faith by the testimony of the fathers,
    and in the voice proceeding from the bright cloud didst wondrously foreshew
    the perfect adoption of they sons: mercifully vouchsafe; that we, being
    made fellow-heirs of the same the King of glory, may likewise attain to
    be partakers of that glory. Through the same Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.'
