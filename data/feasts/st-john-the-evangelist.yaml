introit: 'In the midst of the congregation he opened his mouth; and the Lord
    filled him with the spirit of wisdom and understanding: in a robe of glory
    he arrayed him. A treasure of joy and gladness: hath he given him for
    an inheritance. Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy
    Ghost: As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be: world without
    end. Amen.'
collect: MERCIFUL Lord, we beseech thee to cast thy bright beams of light
    upon thy Church, that it being enlightened by the doctrine of thy blessed
    Apostle and Evangelist Saint John may so walk in the light of thy truth,
    that it may at length attain to the light of everlasting life; through
    Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
epistle_ref: 1 St. John 1:1-end
epistle: 'THAT which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we
    have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have
    handled of the word of life; (for the life was manifested, and we have
    seen it, and bear witness, and shew unto you that eternal life, which
    was with the Father, and was manifested unto us;) That which we have seen
    and heard declare we unto you, that ye also may have fellowship with us;
    and truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ.
    And these things write we unto you, that your joy may be full. This then
    is the message which we have heard of him, and declare unto you, That
    God is light, and in him is no darkness at all. If we say that we have
    fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth:
    but if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship
    one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from
    all sin. If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the
    truth is not in us. If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to
    forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all un-righteousness. If we
    say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in
    us.'
gat: Gradual and Alleluia Proper
gradual: 'Then went this saying abroad among the bretheren, that that disciple
    should not die: yet Jesus said not unto him; He shall not die. But, If
    I will that he tarry till I come: follow thou me.'
alleluia: 'Alleluia. Alleluia. This is the disciple which testifieth of these
    things: and we know that his testimony is true. Alleluia'
gospel_ref: St. John 21:19-end
gospel: 'JESUS said unto Peter, Follow me. Then Peter, turning about, seeth
    the disciple whom Jesus loved following; which also leaned on his breast
    at supper, and said, Lord, which is he that betrayeth thee? Peter seeing
    him saith to Jesus, Lord, and what shall this man do? Jesus saith unto
    him, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee? Follow
    thou me. Then went this saying abroad among the brethren, That that disciple
    should not die: yet Jesus said not unto him, He shall not die; but, If
    I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee? This is the disciple
    which testifieth of these things, and wrote these things, and we know
    that his testimony is true. And there are also many other things which
    Jesus did, the which if they should be written every one, I suppose, that
    even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written.'
offertory: 'The righteous shall flourish like a palm tree: and shall spread
    abroad like a cedar in Libanus.'
communion: 'Then went abroud this saying among the bretheren, that the disciple
