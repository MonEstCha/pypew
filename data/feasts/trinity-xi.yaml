introit: 'God in this holy habitation, it is he that maketh bretheren to be
    of one mind in an house: he will give the dominion of pre-eminence unto
    his people. Let God arise, and let his enemies be scattered: let them
    also that hate him flee before him. Glory be to the Father, and to the
    Son, and to the Holy Ghost. As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever
    shall be: world without end. Amen.'
collect: 'O GOD, who declarest thy almighty power most chiefly in shewing
    mercy and pity: Mercifully grant unto us such a measure of thy grace,
    that we, running the way of thy commandments, may obtain thy gracious
    promises, and be made partakers of thy heavenly treasure; through Jesus
    Christ our Lord. Amen.'
epistle_ref: 1 Corinthians 15:1-11
epistle: 'BRETHEREN, I declare unto you the Gospel which I preached unto you,
    which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand: by which also ye are
    saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed
    in vain. For I delivered unto you first of all, that which I also received,
    how that Christ died for our sins, according to the Scriptures; and that
    he was buried, and that he rose again the third day, according to the
    Scriptures; and that he was seen of Cephas; then of the twelve: after
    that, he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once; of whom the
    greater part remain unto this present, but some are fallen asleep: after
    that, he was seen of James; then of all the Apostles: and last of all,
    he was seen of me also, as of one born out of due time. For I am the least
    of the Apostles, that am not meet to be called an Apostle, because I persecuted
    the Church of God. But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace
    which was bestowed upon me was not in vain; but I laboured more abundantly
    than they all; yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me. Therefore
    whether it were I or they, so we preach, and so ye believed.'
gat: Gradual and Alleluia Proper
gradual: 'My heart hath trusted in God, and I am helped: therefore my heart
    danceth for joy, and in my song will I praise him. Unto thee will I cry,
    O Lord: be not silent, O my God, nor depart from me. '
alleluia: 'Alleluia. Alleluia. Lord, thou hast been our refuge: from one generation
    to another. Alleluia.'
gospel_ref: St. Luke 18:9-14
gospel: 'JESUS spake this parable unto certain which trusted in themselves
    that they were righteous, and despised others: Two men went up into the
    temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a Publican. The Pharisee
    stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank thee that I am not as
    other men are, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this Publican:
    I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess. And the
    Publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as his eyes unto
    heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner.
    I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the
    other: for every one that exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that
    humbleth himself shall be exalted.'
offertory: 'I will magnify thee, O Lord, for thou hast set me up: and not
    made my foes to triumph over me. O Lord, my God, I cried unto thee: and
    thou hast healed me.'
communion: 'Honour the Lord with thy substance, and with the first-fruits
    of all thine increase: so shall thy barns be filled with plenty, and thy
    presses shall burst out with new wine.'
