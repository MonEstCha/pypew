introit: 'The Lord was my refuge and my upholder; and he brought me forth
    into a place of liberty: he delivered me, because he delighted in me.
    I will love thee, O Lord my strength: the Lord is my rock, my fortress
    and my Saviour. Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy
    Ghost. As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be: world without
    end. Amen.'
collect: 'O LORD, who never failest to help and govern them who thou dost
    bring up in thy stedfast fear and love: Keep us, we beseech thee, under
    the protection of thy good providence, and make us to have a perpetual
    fear and love of thy holy Name; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.'
epistle_ref: 1 St. John 3:13-end
epistle: 'MARVEL not, my brethren, if the world hate you. We know that we
    have passed from death unto life, because we love the brethren. He that
    loveth not his brother abideth in death. Whosoever hateth his brother
    is a murderer: and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding
    in him. Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his life
    for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren. But whoso
    hath this world''s good, and seeth his brother have need, and shutteth
    up his bowels of compassion from him; how dwelleth the love of God in
    him? My little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue; but
    in deed, and in truth. And hereby we know that we are of the truth, and
    shall assure our hearts before him. For if our heart condemn us, God is
    greater than our heart, and knoweth all things. Beloved, if our heart
    condemn us not, then have we confidence towards God. And whatsoever we
    ask, we receive of him, because we keep his commandments, and do those
    things that are pleasing in his sight. And this is his commandment, That
    we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another,
    as he gave us commandment. And he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth
    in him, and he in him: and hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the
    Spirit which he hath given us.'

gospel_ref: St. Luke 14:16-24
gospel: A CERTAIN man made a great supper, and bade many; and sent his servant
    at supper-time to say to them that were bidden, Come, for all things are
    now ready. And they all with one consent began to make excuse. The first
    said unto him, I have bought a piece of ground, and I must needs go and
    see it; I pray thee have me excused. And another said, I have bought five
    yoke of oxen, and I go to prove them; I pray thee have me excused. And
    another said, I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot come. So that
    servant came and shewed his lord these things. Then the master of the
    house being angry said to his servant, Go out quickly into the streets
    and lanes of the city, and bring in hither the poor, and the maimed, and
    the halt, and the blind. And the servant said, Lord, it is done as thou
    hast commanded, and yet there is room. And the lord said unto the servant,
    Go out into the high-ways and hedges, and compel them to come in, that
    my house may be filled. For I say unto you, That none of those men which
    were bidden shall taste of my supper.
