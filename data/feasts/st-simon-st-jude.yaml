introit: 'Right dear, O God, are thy friends unto me, and held in highest
    honour: their rule and governance is exceeding steadfast. O Lord, thou
    hast searched me out, and known me: thou knowest my down sitting, and
    mine uprising. Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy
    Ghost: As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be: world without
    end. Amen.'
collect: 'O ALMIGHTY God, who hast built thy Church upon the foundation of
    the Apostles and Prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the head corner-stone:
    Grant us so to be joined together in unity of spirit by their doctrine,
    that we may be made an holy temple acceptable unto thee; through Jesus
    Christ our Lord. Amen.'
epistle_ref: St. Jude 1-8
epistle: 'JUDE, the servant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James, to them
    that are sanctified by God the Father, and preserved in Jesus Christ,
    and called: Mercy unto you, and peace, and love be multiplied. Beloved,
    when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation, it
    was needful for me to write unto you, and exhort you, that ye should earnestly
    contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints. For there
    are certain men crept in unawares, who were before of old ordained to
    this condemnation; ungodly men, turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness,
    and denying the only Lord God and our Lord Jesus Christ. I will therefore
    put you in remembrance, though ye once knew this, how that the Lord, having
    saved the people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed them that
    believed not. And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left
    their own habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness
    unto the judgement of the great day. Even as Sodom and Gomorrha, and the
    cities about them, in like manner giving themselves over to fornication,
    and going after strange flesh, are set forth for an example, suffering
    the vengeance of eternal fire. Likewise also these filthy dreamers defile
    the flesh, despise dominion, and speak evil of dignities.'

gospel_ref: St. John 15:17-end
gospel: 'THESE things I command you, that ye love one another. If the world
    hate you, ye know that it hated me before it hated you. If ye were of
    the world, the world would love his own: but because ye are not of the
    world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth
    you. Remember the word that I said unto you, The servant is not greater
    than the lord: if they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you;
    if they have kept my saying, they will keep yours also. But all these
    things will they do unto you for my name''s sake, because they know not
    him that sent me. If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not
    had sin: but now they have no cloke for their sin. He that hateth me hateth
    my Father also. If I had not done among them the works which none other
    man did, they had not had sin; but now have they both seen and hated both
    me and my Father. But this cometh to pass, that the word might be fulfilled
    that is written in their law, They hated me without a cause. But when
    the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, even
    the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father, he shall testify
    of me: and ye also shall bear witness, because ye have been with me from
    the beginning.'
offertory: 'Thou shalt make them princes in all lands: they shall remember
    thy Name, O Lord, from one generation to another.'
communion: 'Ye which have followed me shall sit upon twelve thrones: judging
    the twelve tribes of Israel, saith the Lord.'
