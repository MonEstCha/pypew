    in all utterance, and in all knowledge; even as the testimony of Christ
    was confirmed in you; so that ye come behind in no gift; waiting for the
    coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, who shall also confirm you unto the end,
    that ye may be blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.

gospel_ref: St. Matthew 22:34-end
gospel: WHEN the Pharisees had heard that Jesus had put the Sadducees to silence,
    they were gathered together. Then one of them, who was a lawyer, asked
    him a question, tempting him, and saying, Master, which is the great commandment
    in the law? Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with
    all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the
    first and great commandment. And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt
    love thy neighbour as thyself. On these two commandments hang all the
    law and the prophets. While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus
    asked them, saying, What think ye of Christ? whose son is he? They say
    unto him, The son of David. He saith unto them, How then doth David in
    spirit call him Lord, saying, the Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on
    my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy foot-stool? If David then
    call him Lord, how is he his son? And no man was able to answer him a
    word; neither durst any man from that day forth ask him any more questions.
offertory: 'Moses consecrated an altar unto the Lord, offering burnt offerings
    upon it, and sacrificing peace offerings: And he made an evening sacrifice
    for a sweet-smelling savour unto the Lord God, in the sight of the children
    of Israel.'
communion: 'Bring offerings, and come into his courts: O worship the Lord
    in the beauty of holiness.'
