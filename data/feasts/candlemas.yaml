introit: 'We have waited, O God, for thy loving-kindness in the midst of thy
    temple; according to thy Name, O God, so is thy praise unto the world''s
    end: thy right hand is full of righteousness. Great is the Lord, and highly
    to be praised: in the city of our God, even upon his holy hill. Glory
    be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost. As it was in
    the beginning, is now, and ever shall be: world without end. Amen.'
collect: ALMIGHTY and everliving God, we humbly beseech thy Majesty, that,
    as thy only-begotten Son was this day presented in the temple in substance
    of our flesh, so we may be presented unto thee with pure and clean hearts,
    by the same thy Son Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
epistle_ref: Malachi 3:1-5
epistle: 'BEHOLD, I will send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before
    me: and the Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to his temple; even
    the messenger of the covenant, whom ye delight in; behold, he shall come,
    saith the Lord of hosts. But who may abide the day of his coming? and
    who shall stand when he appeareth? for he is like a refiner''s fire, and
    like fullers'' soap. And he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver;
    and he shall purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver,
    that they may offer unto the Lord an offering in righteousness. Then shall
    the offerings of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant unto the Lord, as in
    the days of old, and as in former years. And I will come near to you to
    judgement, and I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers, and against
    the adulterers, and against false swearers, and against those that oppress
    the hireling in his wages, the widow and the fatherless, and that turn
    aside the stranger from his right, and fear not me, saith the Lord of
    hosts.'

gospel_ref: St. Luke 2.22-40
gospel: 'AND when the days of her purification, according to the law of Moses,
    were accomplished, they brought him to Jerusalem, to present him to the
    Lord; (as it is written in the law of the Lord, Every male that openeth
    the womb shall be called holy to the Lord;) and to offer a sacrifice,
    according to that which is said in the law of the Lord, A pair of turtle-doves,
    or two young pigeons. And behold, there was a man in Jerusalem, whose
    name was Simeon; and the same man was just and devout, waiting for the
    consolation of Israel: and the Holy Ghost was upon him. And it was revealed
    unto him by the Holy Ghost, that he should not see death, before he had
    seen the Lord''s Christ. And he came by the Spirit into the temple; and
    when the parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him after the custom
    of the law, then took he him up in his arms, and blessed God, and said,
    Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, according to thy word:
    for mine eyes have seen thy salvation, which thou hast prepared before
    the face of all people; a light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory
    of thy people Israel. And Joseph and his mother marvelled at those things
    which were spoken of him. And Simeon blessed them, and said unto Mary
    his mother, Behold, this child is set for the fall and rising again of
    many in Israel; and for a sign which shall be spoken against; (yea, a
    sword shall pierce through thy own soul also;) that the thoughts of many
    hearts may be revealed. And there was one Anna a prophetess, the daughter
    of Phanuel, of the tribe of Aser; she was of a great age, and had lived
    with an husband seven years from her virginity: and she was a widow of
    about fourscore and four years; which departed not from the temple, but
    served God with fastings and prayers night and day. And she coming in
    that instant gave thanks likewise unto the Lord, and spake of him to all
    them that looked for redemption in Jerusalem. And when they had performed
    all things according to the law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee
    to their own city Nazareth. And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit,
    filled with wisdom; and the grace of God was upon him.'
offertory: 'Full of grace are thy lips: because God hath blessed thee for
    ever.'
communion: 'It was revealed unto Simeon by the Holy Spirit: that he should
    not see death, before he had seen the Lord''s Anointed.'
