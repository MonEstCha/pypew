introit: 'O Lord, remove not thy succour afar from me; have respect to my
    defence, and hear me: deliver me from the mouth of the lion; yea, from
    the horns of the unicorns hast thouh regarded my cry. My God, my God,
    look upon me; why hast thou forsaken me: and art so far from my health,
    and from the words of my complaint.'
collect: 'ALMIGHTY and everlasting God, who, of thy tender love towards mankind,
    hast sent thy Son, our Saviour Jesus Christ, to take upon him our flesh,
    and to suffer death upon the cross, that all mankind should follow the
    example of his great humility: Mercifully grant, that we may both follow
    the example of his patience, and also be made partakers of his resurrection;
    through the same Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.'
epistle_ref: Philippians 2:5-11
epistle: 'LET this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus: who, being
    in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God; but made
    himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and
    was made in the likeness of men: and being found in fashion as a man,
    he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of
    the cross. Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a
    name which is above every name; that at the name of Jesus every knee should
    bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth;
    and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the
    glory of God the Father.'

gradual: "Thou hast holden me by my right hand: thou shalt guide me with thy\
    \ counsel, and after that receive me with glory. Truly God is loving unto\
    \ Israel: even unto such as are of a clean heart. Nevertheless, my feet\
    \ were almost gone: my treadings had well nigh slipt. And\u2013why, I\
    \ was grieved at the wicked; I do also see the ungodly in such prosperity."
gospel_ref: St. Matthew 27:1-54
gospel: "WHEN the morning was come, all the chief priests and elders of the\
    \ people took counsel against Jesus, to put him to death. And when they\
    \ had bound him, they led him away, and delivered him to Pontius Pilate\
    \ the governor. Then Judas who had betrayed him, when he saw that he was\
    \ condemned, repented himself, and brought again the thirty pieces of\
    \ silver to the chief priests and elders, saying, I have sinned, in that\
    \ I have betrayed the innocent blood. And they said, What is that to us?\
    \ see thou to that. And he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple,\
    \ and departed, and went and hanged himself. And the chief priests took\
    \ the silver pieces, and said, it is not lawful for to put them into the\
    \ treasury, because it is the price of blood. And they took counsel, and\
    \ bought with them the potter's field, to bury strangers in. Wherefore\
    \ that field was called, The field of blood, unto this day. (Then was\
    \ fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet, saying, And they\
    \ took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was valued,\
    \ whom they of the children of Israel did value, and gave them for the\
    \ potter's field, as the Lord appointed me.)\r\n?\r\nAnd Jesus stood before\
    \ the governor; and the governor asked him, saying, Art thou the King\
    \ of the Jews? And Jesus said unto him, Thou sayest. And when he was accused\
    \ of the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing. Then saith Pilate\
    \ unto him, Hearest thou not how many things they witness against thee?\
    \ And he answered him to never a word, in so much that the governor marvelled\
    \ greatly. Now at that feast the governor was wont to release unto the\
    \ people a prisoner, whom they would. And they had then a notable prisoner,\
    \ called Barabbas. Therefore when they were gathered together, Pilate\
    \ said unto them, Whom will ye that I release unto you? Barabbas, or Jesus\
    \ which is called Christ? For he knew that for envy they had delivered\
    \ him. When he was set down on the judgement-seat, his wife sent unto\
    \ him, saying, Have thou nothing to do with that just man: for I have\
    \ suffered many things this day in a dream because of him. But the chief\
    \ priests and elders persuaded the multitude that they should ask Barabbas,\
    \ and destroy Jesus. The governor answered and said unto them, Whether\
    \ of the twain will ye that I release unto you? They said, Barabbas. Pilate\
    \ saith unto them, What shall I do then with Jesus which is called Christ?\
    \ They all say unto him, Let him be crucified. And the governor said,\
    \ Why, what evil hath he done? But they cried out the more, saying, Let\
    \ him be crucified. When Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing, but\
    \ that rather a tumult was made, he took water, and washed his hands before\
    \ the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this just person:\
    \ see ye to it. Then answered all the people, and said, His blood be on\
    \ us, and on our children. Then released he Barabbas unto them: and when\
    \ he had scourged Jesus he delivered him to be crucified. \r\nThen the\
    \ soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the common hall, and gathered\
    \ unto him the whole band of soldiers. And they stripped him, and put\
    \ on him a scarlet robe. And when they had platted a crown of thorns they\
    \ put it upon his head, and a reed in his right hand: and they bowed the\
    \ knee before him, and mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews. And\
    \ they spit upon him, and took the reed, and smote him on the head. And\
    \ after that they had mocked him they took the robe off from him, and\
    \ put his own raiment on him, and led him away to crucify him. And as\
    \ they came out they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name; him they compelled\
    \ to bear his cross. And when they were come unto a place called Golgotha,\
    \ that is to say, a place of a skull, they gave him vinegar to drink mingled\
    \ with gall: and when he had tasted thereof, he would not drink. And they\
    \ crucified him, and parted his garments, casting lots: that it might\
    \ be fulfilled, which was spoken by the prophet, They parted my garments\
    \ among them, and upon my vesture did they cast lots. And sitting down\
    \ they watched him there; and set up over his head his accusation written,\
    \ THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS. \r\nThen were there two thieves\
    \ crucified with him; one on the right hand, and another on the left.\
    \ And they that passed by reviled him, wagging their heads, and saying,\
    \ Thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days, save\
    \ thyself: if thou be the Son of God, come down from the cross. Likewise\
    \ also the chief priests mocking him, with the scribes and elders, said,\
    \ He saved others, himself he cannot save: if he be the King of Israel,\
    \ let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe him. He trusted\
    \ in God; let him deliver him now, if he will have him: for he said, I\
    \ am the Son of God. The thieves also, which were crucified with him,\
    \ cast the same in his teeth. \r\nNow from the sixth hour there was darkness\
    \ over all the land unto the ninth hour. And about the ninth hour Jesus\
    \ cried with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is\
    \ to say, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? Some of them that\
    \ stood there, when they heard that, said, This man calleth for Elias.\
    \ And straightway one of them ran, and took a spunge, and filled it with\
    \ vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink. The rest said,\
    \ Let be, let us see whether Elias will come to save him. Jesus, when\
    \ he had cried again with a loud voice, yielded up the ghost. \r\nAnd\
    \ behold, the vail of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the\
    \ bottom, and the earth did quake, and the rocks rent, and the graves\
    \ were opened, and many bodies of saints which slept arose, and came out\
    \ of the graves after his resurrection, and went into the holy city, and\
    \ appeared unto many. Now when the centurion and they that were with him,\
    \ watching Jesus, saw the earthquake and those things that were done,\
    \ they feared greatly, saying, Truly this was the Son of God."
offertory: 'Thy rebuke hath broken my heart, I am full of heaviness: I looked
    for some to have pity on me, but there was no man: neither found I any
    to comfort me; they gave me gall to eat, and when I was thirsty they gave
    me vinegar to drink.'
communion: 'O my Father, if this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink
    it: thy will be done.'
