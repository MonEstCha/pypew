name: Epiphany VI
introit: 'All ye Angels of God, fall down, and worship before him: Syon heard,
    and was exceeding joyful, and the daughters of Juda were glad. The Lord
    is King, the earth may be glad thereof: yea, the multitude of the isles
    may be glad thereof. Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the
    Holy Ghost: As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be: world
    without end. Amen.'
collect: 'O GOD, whose blessed Son was manifested that he might destroy the
    works of the devil, and make us the sons of God, and heirs of eternal
    life: Grant us, we beseech thee, that, having this hope, we may purify
    ourselves, even as he is pure; that, when he shall appear again with power
    and great glory, we may be made like unto him in his eternal and glorious
    kingdom; where with thee, O Father, and thee, O Holy Ghost, he liveth
    and reigneth, ever one God, world without end. Amen.'
epistle_ref: 1 St. John 3:1-8
epistle: 'BEHOLD, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that
    we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world knoweth us not,
    because it knew him not. Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth
    not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear,
    we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is. And every man that
    hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he is pure. Whosoever
    committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression
    of the law. And ye know that he was manifested to take away our sins;
    and in him is no sin. Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not: whosoever
    sinneth hath not seen him, neither known him. Little children, let no
    man deceive you: he that doeth righteousness is righteous, even as he
    is righteous. He that committeth sin is of the devil: for the devil sinneth
    from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that
    he might destroy the works of the devil.'

gospel_ref: St. Matthew 24:23-31
gospel: 'THEN if any man shall say unto you, Lo, here  is Christ, or there;
    believe it not. For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets,
    and shall shew great signs and wonders; insomuch that (if it were possible)
    they shall deceive the very elect. Behold, I have told you before. Wherefore,
    if they shall say unto you, Behold, he is in the desert; go not forth:
    Behold, he is in the secret chambers; believe it not. For as the lightning
    cometh out of the east, and shineth even unto the west; so shall also
    the coming of the Son of Man be. For wheresoever the carcase is, there
    will the eagles be gathered together. Immediately after the tribulation
    of those days shall the sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her
    light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens
    shall be shaken. And then shall appear the sign of the Son of Man in heaven:
    and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the
    Son of Man coming in the clouds of heaven, with power and great glory.
    And he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they
    shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven
    to the other.'

    of the Lord bringeth mighty things to pass: I shall not die, but live,
    and declare the works of the Lord.'
communion: 'All wondered at the gracious words: which proceeded out of his
    mouth.'
