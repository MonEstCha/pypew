introit: 'As newborn babes, alleluia: desire ye the sincere milk of the word,
    alleluia, alleluia, alleluia. Sing we merrily unto God, our helper: make
    a cheerful noise unto the God of Jacob. Glory be to the Father, and to
    the Son, and to the Holy Ghost. As it was in the beginning, is now, and
    ever shall be: world without end. Amen.'
collect: "ALMIGHTY Father, who hast given thine only Son to die for our sins,\
    \ and to rise again for our justificat\r\n: Grant us so to put away the\
    \ leaven of malice and wickedness, that we may alway serve thee in pureness\
    \ of living and truth; through the merits of the same thy Son Jesus Christ\
    \ our Lord. Amen."

epistle: 'WHATSOEVER is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the
    victory that overcometh the world, even our faith. Who is he that overcometh
    the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God? This is
    he that came by water and blood, even Jesus Christ; not by water only,
    but by water and blood: and it is the Spirit that beareth witness, because
    the Spirit is truth. For there are three that bear record in heaven, the
    Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one. And there
    are three that bear witness in earth, the spirit, and the water, and the
    blood: and these three agree in one. If we receive the witness of men,
    the witness of God is greater: for this is the witness of God, which he
    hath testified of his Son. He that believeth on the Son of God hath the
    witness in himself: he that believeth not God hath made him a liar, because
    he believeth not the record that God gave of his Son. And this is the
    record, that God hath given to us eternal life; and this life is in his
    Son. He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son hath
    not life.'
gat: Alleluia Proper
alleluia: 'Alleluia. Alleluia. And after eight days, when the doors were shut:
    stood Jesus in the midst of his disciples, and said, Peace be unto you.
    Alleluia. The Angel of the Lord descended from heaven: and came and rolled
    away the stone, and sat upon it. Alleluia.'
gospel_ref: St. John 20:19-23
gospel: 'THE same day at evening, being the first day of the week, when the
    doors were shut, where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews,
    came Jesus and stood in the midst, and saith unto them, Peace be unto
    you. And when he had so said, he shewed unto them his hands and his side.
    Then were the disciples glad when they saw the Lord. Then said Jesus to
    them again, Peace be unto you: As my Father hath sent me, even so send
    I you. And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and saith unto
    them, Receive ye the Holy Ghost. Whosesoever sins ye remit, they are remitted
    unto them; and whosesoever sins ye retain, they are retained.'

    alleluia. '
communion: 'Christ being raised from the dead, dieth no more, alleluia: death
    hath no more dominion over him, alleluia, alleluia.'
