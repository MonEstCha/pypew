introit: 'Look, O Lord, graciously upon thy covenant, and forsake not the
    congregation of the poor for ever: arise, O Lord, maintain thine own cause;
    and be not unmindful of the voices of them that seek thee. O God, wherefore
    art thou absent from us so long: why is thy wrath so hot against the sheep
    of thy pasture? Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy
    Ghost: As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be: world without
    end. Amen.'
collect: 'ALMIGHTY and merciful God, of whose only gift it cometh that thy
    faithful people do unto thee true and laudable service: Grant, we beseech
    thee, that we may so faithfully serve thee in this life, that we fail
    not finally to attain thy heavenly promises; through the merits of Jesus
    Christ our Lord. Amen.'
epistle_ref: Galatians 3:16-22
epistle: 'TO Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He saith not, And
    to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ.
    And this I say, that the covenant that was confirmed before of God in
    Christ, the law, which was four hundred and thirty years after, cannot
    disannul, that it should make the promise of none effect. For if the inheritance
    be of the law, it is no more of promise; but God gave it to Abraham by
    promise. Wherefore then serveth the law? It was added because of transgressions,
    till the seed should come, to whom the promise was made; and it was ordained
    by angels in the hand of a mediator. Now a mediator is not a mediator
    of one; but God is one. Is the law then against the promises of God? God
    forbid: for if there had been a law given which could have given life,
    verily righteousness should have been by the law. But the Scripture hath
    concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might
    be given to them that believe.'
gat: Gradual and Alleluia Proper

gospel_ref: St. Luke 10:23-27
gospel: BLESSED are the eyes which see the things that ye see. For I tell
    you, that many prophets and kings have desired to see those things which
    ye see, and have not seen them; and to hear those things which ye hear,
    and have not heard them. And behold, a certain Lawyer stood up, and tempted
    him, saying, Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life? He said
    unto him, What is written in the law? how readest thou? And he answering
    said, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all
    thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbour
    as thyself. And he said unto him, Thou hast answered right; this do, and
    thou shalt live. But he, willing to justify himself, said unto Jesus,
    And who is my neighbour? And Jesus answering said, A certain man went
    down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among thieves, which stripped
    him of his raiment, and wounded him, and departed, leaving him half dead.
    And by chance there came down a certain Priest that way, and, when he
    saw him, he passed by on the other side. And likewise a Levite, when he
    was at the place, came and looked on him, and passed by on the other side.
    But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was; and, when
    he saw him, he had compassion on him, and went to him, and bound up his
    wounds, pouring in oil and wine, and set him on his own beast, and brought
    him to an inn, and took care of him. And on the morrow, when he departed,
    he took out two pence, and gave them to the host, and said unto him, Take
    care of him; and whatsoever thou spendest more, when I come again, I will
    repay thee. Which now of these three, thinkest thou, was neighbour unto
    him that fell among the thieves? And he said, He that shewed mercy on
    him. Then said Jesus unto him, Go, and do thou likewise.

    my time is in thy hand.'
communion: 'Thou hast given us Bread from heaven, O Lord: having every delight,
