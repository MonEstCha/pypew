    <h1>Feasts</h1>

    <p>On this page you can get information about each of the feasts.
        Each feast has its own texts (readings, collect and propers).
        These are combined with other information to
        <a class="link link-info" href="{{ url_for('pew_sheet_create_view') }}">
        create services</a>. It is also possible that a service
        celebrate two feasts, in which case the texts from the two
        feasts are combined with each other.
