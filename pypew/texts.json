For how else could the recognitional capacity be awakened\ninto use except through objects which stir our senses and partly effect repre-\nsentations of themselves, partly bring our understanding capacity into play to\ncompare these and to connect or separate them, and so to process the raw\nmaterial of sensitive impressions into a recognition of objects which is called\nexperience?"
